                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#f39c12;">12/18/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span> and will take approximately <span style="color:#f39c12;">120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;"><span style="font-size:22px;">Balance Updates</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Alliance</span><br />
In this vast universe, all Capsuleers collectively experience the infinite possibilities of exploration, combat, and cooperation. The nature of New Eden grants every Capsuleer the freedom to develop. However, over time, some Large Alliances have grown to over 5,000 or even 10,000 members, their power far surpassing all other Corps. This immense strength has, to some extent, affected the game's balance and diversity, as well as the potential for interaction and cooperation among Capsuleers, forming a certain degree of "Monopoly." To maintain the ecosystem and vitality of New Eden, and to provide more fun and strategic possibilities, we plan to implement significant updates to Alliances and Diplomacy, including the following three aspects:<br />
Alliance Sustention Fee, Diplomacy Sustention Fee, and Alliance Size<br />
We plan to spend 2-3 months gradually raising these Fees and imposing a stronger size limit, making it easier for Capsuleers to notice this important change and reorganize their Alliances and diplomacy before the rules update.<br />
In this patch:<br />
Remove the Alliance Management skills. Capsuleers can reset it to Free Skill Points for free.<br />
The maximum number of members in an Alliance has been increased to 30, and the Sustention Fee will increase along with it. This fee could potentially be reduced in the future.<br />
A Corp must reach level 4 "Elite" to create an Alliance, and cannot create another Alliance within 180 days after creating one.<br />
The weekly Alliance Sustention Fee will increase in tiers with the maximum number of Member Corps in the Alliance, as follows:<br />
No more than 10 Member Corps. Total Fee: Number of Corps x 2 Million.<br />
11-15 Member Corps. Total Fee: Number of Corps x 20 Million.<br />
16-20 Member Corps. Total Fee: Number of Corps x 100 Million.&nbsp;<br />
21-25 Member Corps. Total Fee: Number of Corps x 300 Million.&nbsp;<br />
26-30 Member Corps. Total Fee: Number of Corps x 500 Million.<br />
(Learn more from the Introduction in the Alliance interface)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">In about 2 weeks, a Diplomacy Sustention Fee will be introduced, and the Alliance Sustention Fee will be raised. As the fees gradually increase, we will continue to monitor whether this adjustment positively impacts Capsuleer's experience, Alliance size, and diplomatic relations and further refine the plan.<br />
Through the above adjustments, we hope New Eden will blossom with more exciting stories, offering more opportunities and changes and allowing each Alliance and Corp to have its own unique story. We will also continue to monitor and optimize the complexity of Corp management, the cost of piloting ships, and the difficulty of skill training. In the future, we will make more significant adjustments and optimizations to insurance, market, and construction, enabling Capsuleers to participate in the universal market, construction, insurance, and delivery systems more easily and be more willing to pilot their favorite ships across the universe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Loyalty Point Store</span><br />
Since the opening of the Militia Store, its usage rate has reached several times that of the "LP Exchange" Store. To improve the convenience of Capsuleers purchasing items and reduce the complexity of purchases, CONCORD has decided to close the "LP Exchange" Store and further increase the number of items in the Militia Store.<br />
Items being removed include: Test and Modified Modules, Drones and Drone Blueprints, Core Supply Chests, and Pirate Faction Modules. Please purchase them as soon as possible if you need them, Capsuleer.<br />
The Militia Store will be renamed to the Loyalty Point Store and will include non-Pirate Faction Modules, such as Drone Damage Amplifiers and Damage Control.<br />
Data Compilers from the four major Empires can now be traded on the market.<br />
Price Adjustment:<br />
The three types of Needlejack Filaments will be available at a 50% discount after the update.<br />
The four Empire Bomb blueprints have been combined into an Opt Box, and after the update, they will be available at a 25% discount.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Insurance</span><br />
When the insurance company creates buy orders, they will only acquire items at the Jita Trading Center.<br />
The multiplier for triggering the insurance pool for all items has been reduced, making it easier for newly released items to trigger buy orders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Insurance Introduction<br />
Sell PLEX: When Capsuleers claim items, the insurance points spent will be converted into a certain proportion of PLEX, which the insurance company will list at the Alikara Trading Center for other Capsuleers to purchase.<br />
Buying Item: When the entire New Eden claims a certain item exceeding its valuation by a certain multiple, the insurance company will create a buy order at the valuation price and buy it at the ITC closest to the claiming station.<br />
Insurance Office: It can be simply understood as converting market orders into buy contracts for a designated Corp. However, this mechanism is too complicated, and causes buy contracts and orders in null-sec to be too scattered, with quantities significantly lower than that in High Sec and Low Sec. The functionality of this structure will be reworked in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Reminder:</strong> Capsuleers should pay more attention to the buy orders at the Jita Trading Center. Ships such as the CyanSea, Apocalypse Navy Issue, and Nestor are popular items. Selling surplus ships and modules to the insurance company can earn a substantial amount of ISK.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Planetary Production</span><br />
Currently, novice Capsuleers can only mine a negligible amount of planetary resources. However, groups violating the rules can use multiple novice accounts registered in bulk or purchased illegally to obtain and transfer planetary resources in various covert ways, thereby gaining undue benefits. This violates the EULA and severely harms the interests of other Capsuleers.<br />
The previous penalties were ineffective in addressing the issue of newly created accounts profiting in a timely manner. Significant adjustments will be made to Planetary Production to protect the legitimate interests of every Capsuleer and reduce the impact of illegal mass-created accounts. The specifics are as follows:<br />
Alpha Clones will no longer be able to use the Planetary Production feature.<br />
The Standard Omega Clone will receive an additional 4 sets of Mining Arrays, effective on each planet (the Duo Bundle Omega Clone also receives the same bonus).<br />
A new Advanced Resource Extraction Management Center has been added. Improved from the Basic model, it has higher numbers of mining planets and Mining Arrays. It can be manufactured from the blueprints purchased from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Through the above adjustments, the benefits of Planetary Production will be expected to be distributed to every real Capsuleer rather than to inappropriately registered bot novice accounts.<br />
In a mature market environment, novice pilots' production and combat capabilities differ significantly from those of experienced Capsuleers. A round of special optimizations will be launched in the future to improve the experience during the novice phase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Module Adjustments</span><br />
To reduce the differences in the Yan-Jung Armor System Refactoring under different fittings, the following adjustments have been made to its shield, armor, and resistance bonuses:<br />
Adjusted the Base Shield to 150,000 and Base Armor to 300,000.<br />
-20% Shield. +20% Armor.<br />
-20% Shield Resistance. +20% Armor Resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Modules</span><br />
Moonchaser Narrow Resonance Scanner. Improved based on the "Explorer" model, it is used to detect signals of space entities such as ships and structures within a system. This model can receive and ignore signals from Capsuleer ships of the same fleet, Corporation, and Alliances.<br />
Windseeker Narrow Resonance Scanner. Improved based on the "Explorer" model, it can receive and ignore ship signals from Capsuleers in the same fleet, corporation, and alliances and automatically analyze, identify, and ignore all structure signals.<br />
Integrated Auto Salvager/Salvage Drone. Based on the "Union" model, its design integrates the advantages of various salvagers. This salvager can automatically identify and salvage unencrypted common loot crates. Due to safety protocols, this salvager will not salvage Capsuleer ship wrecks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Cosmic Anomaly</span><br />
Wasteseeker Lost Fleet. The loot from defeating Elite Wasteseekers now includes Resonance Scanner blueprints (rare items).<br />
Gravitational Wave Graph. Loot crates now have a chance to contain new Salvager and Resonance Scanner blueprints (rare items).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Arrivals</span><br />
Event Time: December 18, 2024, 08:00 - February 26, 2025, 08:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Blue-and-White Porcelain and Sleeper Series Nanocore Limited-Time Rerun Discount Sale</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">The Lost Wasteseeker Fleet Returns</span><br />
Event Time: December 18, 2024, 08:00 - January 22, 2025, 08:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Many Wasteseeker Fleets have appeared across various systems. CONCORD, after observation, suspects these are just the Wasteseeker's vanguard, with an unknown crisis possibly lurking in the shadows, ready to strike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Optimizations</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Optimized the market grouping of items like Ore Hold modifications.<br />
Optimized the warp morph effects of ships like the Pacifier.<br />
Optimized the notes for all Structures, removing unnecessary information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Bug Fixes</span><br />
Fixed the issue where the attributes of the Nanocore might be in white color.</span></p>
