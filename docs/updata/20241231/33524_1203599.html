                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#f39c12;">1/1/2025 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span> and will take approximately <span style="color:#f39c12;">120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Content</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Fortizar</span><br />
The Fortizar is a combat-type Corporation Citadel, developed based on the latest spaceship and Structure technology, possessing strong defensive capabilities. In addition to conventional Structure Weapons, it can also be fitted with specialized modules such as Territorial Claim Units and Structure Jump Drive Systems to meet diverse needs.<br />
Both the Fortizar and Capsuleer Outpost can be fitted with various Low Slot modules, but due to different technologies, the two types of modules are not interchangeable.<br />
The Fortizar can dock most ships, including Supercarriers, and can serve as the headquarters for small and medium-sized Corporations and Alliances or as an outpost for large Alliances.<br />
To reduce the pressure on small and medium-sized Corporations and Alliances, CONCORD plans to gradually introduce exclusive Construction Blocks that can only be used by small and medium-sized Corporations and Alliances (i.e., those with less Sovereignty), enhancing their combat and production capabilities.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Deploying Fortizar</span><br />
When a Corporation reaches level 5 "Glory," the "Fortizar Operating System" Corporation Tech can be unlocked. Once unlocked, Fortizars can be anchored in most low sec and null sec systems.<br />
Anchoring a Fortizar does not grant System Sovereignty, so multiple Fortizars can be anchored in one System. Similar to Capsuleer Outposts, the maximum number of Fortizars that can be anchored in each System varies. In null sec system, it ranges from 4 to 5.<br />
Each Corporation can anchor a maximum of 1 Fortizar, but is not restricted by the size of Sovereignty.<br />
The Fortizar can only be destroyed or unanchored and cannot be captured by an Entosis Link.<br />
Unanchoring is only possible when the Fortizar is in a normal state. Due to its significantly higher integration compared to the Corporation Citadel, the anchoring and un-anchoring time of the Fortizar is shorter than the Citadel Upgrade time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Territorial Claim Unit</span><br />
A special ancillary module for structures. Used to declare System Sovereignty to the entire universe. Only structures supporting this technology can be fitted with it, and currently, it can only be fitted on the Fortizar.<br />
When a Capsuleer operates the Fortizar in a conquerable System that has not yet been claimed, they can fit the Territorial Claim Unit. Once fitted, the System Sovereignty is immediately acquired.<br />
Modules cannot be removed within 24 hours after fitting. After 24 hours, Capsuleers can also choose to remove the Territorial Claim Unit, relinquishing System Sovereignty.<br />
Note that during a state of war, the modules of the Fortizar cannot be adjusted, nor can System Sovereignty be acquired or relinquished. If the Fortizar is destroyed, System Sovereignty will be lost.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Structure Jump Drive Systems</span><br />
A type of extra-large distributed mechanical device. The intact Standup Jump Drive System consists of a jump drive array, integrated structure network, structure core stabilizer, and other devices. This system is used to propel structures through wormhole space. It is said that the successful development owes much to the Sun Chaser Navigation System and numerous asteroids.<br />
This complex system requires precise rigging operations to be fitted on the Fortizar, with a high level of technical difficulty. It can only be disassembled when the structure is in a normal state.<br />
After installing the engine, the Corporation CEO or Director can operate the Fortizar and open the Star Charts to select a System, initiating engine preheating. Once preheating is complete, it will attempt to jump to a location near the star of the target System. After preheating starts, all Capsuleers can see the operation marker on the Star Charts.<br />
This jump system has many launch restrictions, mainly including the followings:<br />
*Cannot activate engine preheat in war state<br />
*Cannot jump while fitted with the Territorial Claim Unit<br />
*Can only jump from Low-Sec to Low-Sec, or from a null sec system to a null sec system<br />
*Cannot jump to systems occupied by other alliances<br />
*Cannot jump to Wasteseeker-related regions<br />
One minute before the jump, the Fortizar protection system turns up to the highest level, making all Capsuleer services unavailable (including docking or undocking). After a successful jump, all members and ships within the Fortizar will jump to the target system, and the Fortizar jump drive will enter a restart state for a period of time.<br />
Note: If the Fortizar experiences strong warp scrambling, the jump may fail.<br />
Important&nbsp;notice:&nbsp;This&nbsp;system&nbsp;is&nbsp;still&nbsp;in&nbsp;its&nbsp;early&nbsp;experimental&nbsp;phase&nbsp;and&nbsp;may&nbsp;undergo&nbsp;significant&nbsp;adjustments&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future.&nbsp;Capsuleers&nbsp;are&nbsp;advised&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it&nbsp;cautiously&nbsp;as&nbsp;needed.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Fortizar Basic Services</span><br />
Thanks to cutting-edge technology and integrated design bonuses, Fortizar initially comes with manufacturing, reverse engineering, reprocessing, compression, repair, and cloning center services.<br />
Fortizar has no additional energy anchor points, but will gain capabilities similar to add-on structures through various integrated modules and Corporation Tech in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Corporation Tech</span><br />
Fortizar Operating System, unlocks at Level 5, allows Fortizar anchoring upon mastery<br />
Core technology of Structure Jump Drive, unlocks at Tier 6, increases max jump range upon mastery</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Corporation and Alliance Diplomacy Updates</span><br />
To reduce the phenomenon of "Monopoly" and alleviate the pressure on Small and Medium Corporations and Alliances, a new Diplomacy Sustention Fee has been introduced. Every 7 days, a certain Sustention Fee will need to be paid based on the number of diplomatic entities added by the Alliance or Corporation. Meanwhile, the maximum number of diplomatic entities for Alliances and Corporations has been adjusted. The specific fees and corresponding numbers are as follows:<br />
1 Friendly Alliance. 500 Million ISK in total every week.<br />
2 Friendly Alliances. 1500 Million ISK in total every week.<br />
3 Friendly Alliances. 3000 Million ISK in total every week.<br />
1-10 Friendly Corps. Free.<br />
11-20 Friendly Corps. 200 Million ISK in total every week.<br />
21-30 Friendly Corps. 500 Million ISK in total every week.<br />
You may declare up to 3 Friendly Alliances and 30 Friendly Corps. If exceeded, it must be adjusted by Corporation Management. Otherwise, the diplomatic relations will become invalid. They will automatically restore when the numbers meet the conditions.<br />
Declaring Hostile Alliances and Corps does not require a Sustention Fee. A war declaration feature will be introduced in the future, at which time a certain fee will be required. You can declare up to 3 Hostile Alliances and 30 Hostile Corps.<br />
Whether Friendly or Hostile, you can declare up to 150 Capsuleers as Friendly or Hostile. No Sustention Fee is required.<br />
The Sustention Fee for each Corporation will be deducted from the Corporation Wallet. Note that the Alliance Diplomacy Sustention Fee is paid by the Executor Corp.<br />
Capsuleers cannot add Corps or Alliances as contacts.<br />
CONCORD&nbsp;is&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;update&nbsp;and&nbsp;will&nbsp;soon&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the&nbsp;Alliance&nbsp;Sustention&nbsp;Fee&nbsp;based&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Sovereignties&nbsp;held&nbsp;by&nbsp;Alliances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Balance Adjustments</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Currently, some Nanocores yield Generic Materials after Reprocessing, while others yield materials for specific models. To improve convenience, all Nanocores will now yield Clone Bound generic materials after Reprocessing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">CONCORD Pass<br />
Open Time: Jan 1, 2025 00:00 - Jan 29, 2025 00:00 (UTC+0)<br />
CONCORD Pass will start on January 1, 2025.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Starbreak Key Store Reopen<br />
Open Time: Jan 1, 2025 08:00 - Feb 12, 2025 08:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Some players voiced out that they hadn't redeemed all rewards with the Starbreak Key, so the Starbreak Key Exchange Store has reopened. Capsuleers who haven't redeemed the rewards yet, please proceed to exchange promptly.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Optimizations</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Optimized the categorization of some items in the Store<br />
Optimized the sorting category of Drones in the Overview Settings<br />
Optimized the method and alert for Refueling when Operating Structures<br />
