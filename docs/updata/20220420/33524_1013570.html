                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on 4/20/2022 at 08:00 (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">New Content</span></strong></em></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Combat Commendation</span></strong><br />
Capsuleers can apply to the CONCORD for an additional reward for each bounty gained from repelling Pirates in the last 7 days (open the Wallet page &gt; Filter &gt; Bounty Rewards). CONCORD will grant ISK equal to 100% of the Bounty as an additional reward to encourage Capsuleers to continue fighting Pirates and defending the peace of New Eden.<br />
Each bounty can only be claimed once, and it would be better for Capsuleers to destroy pirates as quickly as possible to get better results and claim extra bounties. Also, there is a max limit for each bounty of 50 million for now.<br />
The higher the Tech Level, the more times you can apply for combat commendation every week. Unused applications can be stored for up to 4 weeks for future use. Please check detailed rules in the in-game wallet interface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Corporation Management Updates</span></strong><br />
When the Corporation leader is offline for more than 21 days, Corporation members can initiate a vote to change the CEO. Voting lasts for 48 hours. The vote is a registered ballot and the results will be made public. When voting is over, the Capsuleer with the highest number of votes will become the new Corps CEO.<br />
Only Corporation members who have joined the Corporation and logged into the game within 3 days before the voting starts will be eligible to vote and can be voted for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Eden Store Updates</span></strong><br />
1. From April 21st to May 3rd, some limited-time packs will be added to the Hot Selection, such as "Lazarus Unit Value Bundle", "Lazarus Unit Bundle", "Lazarus Unit Special Offer", etc.<br />
2. At weekends, some limited-time packs will be added to the Hot Selection, such as "Weekend Special Offer - Lazarus Unit Bundle", "Weekend Special Offer - Skill Conversion Bundle", etc. (From April 22 to April 24, and from April 29 to May 1st.)<br />
3. After this update, some items will be no longer available in the New Eden Store, such as "Nanocore Supply Chest", "Combatant Supplies - Medium", "Manufacturer Supply", etc.</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">NEW EVENT</span></span></strong></em><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Lazarus Unit Gift</span></strong><br />
Considering that Capsuleers may have Lazarus Unit needs after the balance adjustment, the CONCORD will provide Capsuleers with Lazarus Unit gifts.<br />
During the event, when the Tech Level reaches 5, you can receive the Lazarus Unit. For higher Tech Levels, each level will unlock more rewards to be claimed. The exact amount is in accordance with the in-game event page.</span></p>
