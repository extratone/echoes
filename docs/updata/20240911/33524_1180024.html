<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">The Kalevala Expanse</span><br />
Fleet creation of any form will be completely prohibited within the region<br />
Everyone's name will no longer be public within the region, and will be shown as "Unknown Capsuleer" in space and the overview</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Event</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Relics Scramble Open</span><br />
Sleeper relics have been discovered in some low-security systems, and the major Empire Militias are recruiting Capsuleers to explore them. Travel to these systems, defeat Sleepers and other faction's Capsuleers to earn rewards such as merits and LP.<br />
Event Duration: Long-term<br />
How to Participate:<br />
In the events interface, join one of the four Imperial Militia factions as an individual.<br />
Open the Star Charts and the Event Interface to see which systems are at war. Use autopilot or long-distance cloning to enter the system.<br />
After joining the Militia and entering the system at war, you may warp to a relic site for exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">How to Explore:</span><br />
Combat: Warp to large relics through the overview, defeat Sleepers and other faction's Capsuleers to obtain loot and merits<br />
Scanning: Use the scanner to discover small relics, which will not be directly shown in the overview<br />
Data Collection: Gain LP by collecting relic data. Large, medium, and small collection stations are suitable for ships of different tonnages, and there are no extra-large collection stations</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Rank Promotion:</span><br />
After joining the Militia of one of the four major Empires, you can earn merits and advance your rank by defeating enemy faction's Capsuleers. If you leave the faction, your rank will be reset to Lieutenant.<br />
When defeating enemy faction's Capsuleers, all participants will earn an amount of merits (the Capsuleer landing the final blow will earn more). If the participant's rank is more than 3 levels higher than the defeated Capsuleer's rank, no merits will be awarded.<br />
If you destroy a Capsuleer from the same Militia, the sentry guns will attack you. In addition to the warning timer penalty, you will also lose double the merits.<br />
Additionally, participating in the Faction Wargames can earn you ranks granted by CONCORD, which coexist with the ranks of the four major Empires but cannot be directly transferred to the Empires' Militias</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Insurance Discounts:</span><br />
If a Capsuleer joins the Militia and is destroyed by other Militia's members in a system at war, the faction insurance companies will provide bonus compensation for the Insurance Points actually spent on such losses.<br />
The current additional compensation rates are: 75% for Regular Ships and 25% for Capital Ships</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Notes:<br />
After joining the Militia, they may be attacked by other Militia's members in systems at war, and CONCORD will not prevent such combat. This will disregard the Capsuleer's Corporation's standing with the Alliances.<br />
Capsuleers not enlisted in the Militia are unaffected in systems at war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Militia Supply Store</span><br />
Event Duration: Long-term<br />
The supply stores of the CONCORD and the Empires accept LP and mainly offers supplies such as faction modules, blueprints, and materials.<br />
Valuable items in the store can only be redeemed after reaching certain ranks.<br />
This store will be updated regularly and will eventually replace the LP Store. Capsuleers should redeem items from the Loyalty Point Store as soon as possible if they need anything from it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Voyage Ceremony Recording</span><br />
CONCORD will restore the data from the corporation's Voyage Ceremony and create a highlight compilation clip, which will be uploaded to relevant websites for Capsuleers to enjoy again. Please stay tuned for more details<br />
Ceremony Review</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#e67e22;">Optimizations</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">After initiating moon drilling, the corporation CEO and initiator will receive a notification email<br />
In the description interfaces for modules and ships, the "final value percentage" bonus for certain attributes will now display an additional decimal point (%.). For example, the Heat Sink's (damage +16.5%) refers to the base damage, while the "Longbow" Tactical Module's (damage +15%.) bonus refers to the final damage<br />
Optimized the description of IP items, including an introduction to the insurance system's operation and mechanism<br />
