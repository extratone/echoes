                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">Dear Pilots,&nbsp;<br />
The EVE Echoes Test Server for the balance update <span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>will be open at 8:00 am (UTC+0), April 9th and will close at 10am (UTC+0), April 12th.</strong></span> To ensure players can continue to play on the Normal Server during the test, the test server will be released with a separate apk. You can click <a href="https://bit.ly/3uldmwb" target="_blank">here</a> to pre-download and install the test server. Please understand that the test is only available on Android devices due to the restrictions of Apple policy.<br />
Please note that the accounts and data on Test Server are temporary, and are not related to your existing accounts on the Normal Server, and all data will be wiped after the test. Please try to avoid using the account and password on the test server that you frequently use.<br />
To make sure every Pilot can better experience the updates and changes on Test Server, we will provide all needed resources like ISK, Skill Points and PLEX for you through in-game mail. Thank you for your understanding and continued support! All your suggestions and feedback are important to us!<br />

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><em><strong>New Features</strong></em></span></span><br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;">Combat Commedation</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">Capsuleers can apply to the CONCORD for an additional reward for each bounty gained from repelling Pirates in the last 7 days (open the Wallet page&gt; Filter &gt; Bounty Rewards). CONCORD will grant <strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">ISK equal to 100% of the Bounty</span></strong> as an additional reward to encourage Capsuleers to continue fighting Pirates and defending the peace of New Eden.<br />
Each bounty can only be claimed once, and it would be better for <strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Capsuleers to destroy pirates as quickly as possible to get better results and claim extra bounties.</span></strong> Also, there is a max limit for each bounty of 200 million for now.<br />
The higher the Tech Level, the more times you can apply for combat commendation every week. Unused applications can be stored for up to 4 weeks for future use. Please check the detailed rules in the in-game wallet interface.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;">Lazarus Unit Gift</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">Considering that Capsuleers may have Lazarus Unit needs after the balance adjustment, the CONCORD will provide Capsuleers with Lazarus Unit gifts.<br />
During the event, when the Tech Level reaches 5, you can receive the Lazarus Unit. For higher Tech Levels, each level will unlock more rewards to be claimed. The exact amount is in accordance with the in-game event page.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;">Corporation Management Updates</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">When the Corporationleader is offline for more than 21 days, Corporation members can initiate a vote to change the CEO. Voting lasts for 48 hours. The vote is a registered ballot and the results will be made public. When voting is over, the Capsuleer with the highest number of votes will become the new Corps CEO.<br />
Only Corporation members who have joined the Corporation and logged into the game within 3 days before the voting starts will be eligible to vote and can be voted for.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Anti-Drone Pulse Bomb</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">Introducing the Anti-Drone Pulse Bomb, a High Slot module that is usually fitted onto battleships. When enabled, it can damage all drones and fighters within a certain range.<br />

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">PLEX Price Restrictions</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">A measure to stop malicious manipulation of the PLEX price. From now on, whenever a player attempts to sell PLEX/alter PLEX price/acquire PLEX, the price they set must be within this range:<br />
<strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Weekly Valuation x 80% ≤ Price ≤ Weekly Valuation x 120%</span></strong></span></p>
