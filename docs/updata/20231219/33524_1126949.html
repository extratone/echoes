                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#FF8C00;">12/20/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">The Kalevala Expanse</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Region Briefing</span><br />
After a long period of hard work, CONCORD and the trailblazers have completed the initial exploration of The Kalevala Expanse, and the information is now made available to all capsuleers.<br />
The Kalevala Expanse region is composed of 10 constellations, with a total of 69 systems, all of which are assessed below a security level of 0.<br />
This region is controlled by "Wasteseeker Drones", with a large number of "Wasteseeker Centrum", Wasteseeker Encampments, and undiscovered relics distributed throughout the region.<br />
Capsuleers can use Spatial Rift Filaments to construct routes to enter or leave The Kalevala Expanse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Constellation Distribution</span><br />
The Stargates leading to the outside regions from The Kalevala Expanse have been cut off, the systems within the region are not fully connected, and can be roughly divided into western constellations, southern constellations, and northern constellations, a total of 3 areas.<br />
Western constellations include: 3NA-Z1, P-B2NE, 8UD2-J. The main enemies are small Wasteseeker fleets.<br />
Southern constellations include: 2O-VY7, U-HSM3, XPG-HE. Medium and small Wasteseeker fleets are quite common.<br />
The four constellations other than the aforementioned six are the northern constellations, with various enemy fleets and the most dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Structure Info</span><br />
Due to the unique environment of the system, The Kalevala Expanse is currently completely controlled by Wasteseeker Drones, the trailblazers have not established a station, and capsuleers cannot anchor any structures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">System Broadcast</span><br />
The Kalevala Expanse does not have a broadcast management center, so it is impossible to view online capsuleers, and the local population is displayed as ?.<br />
Capsuleers cannot obtain standings, they can only recognize fleet members and contacts, all other individuals will not display standings.<br />
Capsuleers may choose to broadcast their own local messages so that other capsuleers in the current system can receive them, but doing so will reveal their own presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Ore Resources</span><br />
The Kalevala Expanse shares a similar ore distribution to that of the Asteroid Belt in Cobalt Edge, with gas cloud C70 being a currently popular resource.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Planetary Resources</span><br />
The planetary resources of The Kalevala Expanse do not significantly differ from those found in other regions within New Eden.<br />
Due to the high difficulty of leaving the region and the inability to anchor structures, this region is currently unsuitable as a regular location for Planetary Resources Harvesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Wasteseeker Centrum</span><br />
The Kalevala Expanse is a heartland region for Wasteseeker Drones, with the complex site of the "Wasteseeker Centrum" present in every system.<br />
Each Centrum consists of several sectors, which are linked by Acceleration Gates. Use the gates by defeating the enemies.<br />
The main enemies in the sector are Elite Advanced Wasteseeker Drones, defeating them can yield a variety of materials and items.<br />
After defeating the enemies in certain sectors, some unanalyzed Relics will become accessible, allowing capsuleers to obtain blueprints, materials, and other valuable loot from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Spatial Rift Filaments</span><br />
To monitor the movements of the Wasteseeker Drones, CONCORD and corporations such as ORE have jointly launched the "Drone Program". Through the use of excessive data analysis simulation, new "Expedition" and "Homeward" Spatial Rift Filaments have been introduced, allowing direct entry or exit from The Kalevala Expanse.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">"Expedition" Spatial Rift Filament</span><br />
The first series of "Expedition" Spatial Rift Filaments includes five models to meet different combat requirements.<br />
Small "Expedition-4" Spatial Rift Filament, supports 4 small SHIPS, and leads to a random system in the western Constellation of The Kalevala Expanse.<br />
Medium "Expedition-4" Spatial Rift Filament, supports 4 medium or small SHIPS, and leads to the southern Constellation.<br />
Large "Expedition-4" Spatial Rift Filament, supports 4 battleships or SHIPS of lower tonnage, and leads to the northern Constellation.<br />
Large "Expedition-1" Spatial Rift Filament II, improved from the 'Basic' model, available in limited quantities, only suitable for 1 battleship or SHIPS of lower tonnage, can break through the environmental restrictions of the southern Constellation, and can lead to a random system in the southern or northern Constellation.<br />
Large "Expedition-1" Spatial Rift Filament III, with stronger breakthrough ability, can lead to a random system within The Kalevala Expanse, and is the hardest to obtain.<br />
Due to the environmental effects and technological limitations of The Kalevala Expanse region, the "Expedition" Spatial Rift Filaments can only be used when no other cargo is loaded in the ship's cargo hold.<br />
How to Obtain 1: Obtained by destroying any Wasteseeker Drone in the Cobalt Edge or The Kalevala Expanse<br />
How to Obtain 2: Obtained by scanning any Relics<br />
How to Obtain 3: Obtain from Inquisitor and 'Scout' Cosmic Anomaly<br />
How to Obtain (Limited Time): Purchased with ISK in the Store</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">"Homeward" Spatial Rift Filament</span><br />
Specifically designed for the special environment of The Kalevala Expanse and massively deployed in this region, it can directly return to a random system within the major empires after use, and can only be used in this region.<br />
"Homeward-1" Spatial Rift Filament, in order to break through environmental restrictions, it can stably construct a route around a star, which takes a long time.<br />
"Homeward-1" Spatial Rift Filament II, under certain environmental conditions within the "Wasteseeker Centrum", the route can be quickly completed. Using it around stars takes longer time.<br />
How to Obtain 1: Obtained by destroying Wasteseeker Drones in The Kalevala Expanse.<br />
How to Obtain 2: Obtained from the Loot Crate in the Wasteseeker Centrum.<br />
Tips: This type of Spatial Rift Filament cannot be traded and cannot be reprocessed for the time being.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Content</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Capital Stasis Grappler</span><br />
A mid-slot module that gradually reduces the flight velocity of the target ship. The closer the distance to the target, the faster the velocity decrease stacks; the more times it is used, the stronger the velocity decrease effect.<br />
After being out of the capture range for a while, the flight velocity will restore to normal.<br />
Due to its high power consumption, it can only be fitted to capital ships, and each ship can only install one of them.<br />
How to obtain: Obtain the blueprint through Capital Ship Rifts and Capital Ship Proving Grounds and manufacture it</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Star Beat Nanocore Appearance Update</span><br />
We will launch the second batch of updates for the Star Beat Nanocores and their corresponding SKINs<br />
