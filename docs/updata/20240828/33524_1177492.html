                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">8/28/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span></strong> and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Content</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Structure: Moon Drilling Array</span><br />
New Corporation Add-on Structure: Moon Drilling Array.<br />
After anchoring the structure and acquiring the Moon Drilling Corporation Tech, you can initiate moon drilling to extract resources from moons within the System. The drilling takes 20 hours, and upon success, the drilling array must be reactivated to gather and form Ubiquitous Moon Asteroid Clusters.<br />
Ubiquitous Moon Asteroid Clusters contain Moon Ore and Star Crystals, as well as ores like Scordite and Dark Ochre. Due to the high value of some ores, be wary of enemy Covert Ops Mining Frigates and organize large-scale mining fleets for extraction as soon as possible. The harvested ore can be used for Reprocessing and Construction.<br />
It's important to note that while there is no limit to anchoring, the drilling function can only be activated after acquiring the Moon Drilling Corporation Tech. Only one Moon Drilling can be conducted once per week in each system at most. For more details, please refer to the relevant operation interface.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Corporation Tech</span><br />
Added the new Corporation Tech: Moon Drilling Technology, which requires the Corporation to reach level 5 (Honored level) to upgrade this technology.<br />
This technology is key to the Moon Drilling Array. Mastering it allows the activation of the Moon Drilling Array and the development of Moon resources in occupied Systems.<br />
Added the new Corporation Tech: Moon Drilling Array Reinforcement, which requires the Corporation to reach level 6 (Sanctum level) to upgrade this technology.<br />
Master it to improve the performance of the drilling array system and increase the chances of discovering Ubiquitous Moon Asteroid Clusters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Ore and Materials</span><br />
Added Moon Ore and Star Crystal, which can be obtained through Moon Drilling. These ores can be simply reprocessed into a small amount of planetary materials, making them more suitable as raw materials for some new types of materials. Such as:<br />
Moon Ore: It can be reprocessed into metals and alloys<br />
Star Crystal: It can be reprocessed into Crystals and a small amount of Fuel<br />
Fullerides: It can be manufactured from materials such as gas clouds, Moon Ore, and Star Crystal, serving as an excellent superconductive material commonly used in capacitors, Shield Emitters, and Weapon Systems.<br />
Sylramic Fibers: It can be manufactured from materials such as minerals, gas clouds, and System Crystals. They are used in laminated armor coatings as super high-strength filaments, significantly reducing armor weight while enhancing protection.<br />
The new ores come in 2 types and 8 varieties and cannot be compressed currently. There are a total of 9 types of new materials. For more details, view the Construction interface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Moon Mineral Reprocessing Skills</span><br />
Skills for reprocessing moon minerals. Master it to increase the yield when reprocessing Moon Ore and Star Crystals.<br />
How to obtain: Purchase and train with ISK.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Ship</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Four new Destroyers and five new Faction Battleships have been added. These ships are the improved models based on their prototypes and possess considerable combat capabilities with the support of new materials.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Imperial Destroyer: Endurer, Nightcrow, Erato, Salamander</span><br />
Developed by the four major empires based on the Coercer, Corax, Catalyst, and Thrasher, these ships have enhanced defensive capabilities and overall combat effectiveness, offering a wider range of fitting options.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Faction Battleships:</span><br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Cobra</span><br />
Based on the Rattlesnake, it has achieved an all-around combat power upgrade and can be equipped with a Missile Launcher Bomb. Its versatile combat capabilities allow it to adapt flexibly to battlefield situations and efficiently respond to various tactical environments.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Azazel</span><br />
Based on the Bhaalgorn, the defensive armor has been reinforced using advanced materials. With its significantly improved electronic warfare system performance, it can perform energy drain tactics at a longer range, rapidly weakening enemy combat capabilities. It can also be fitted with Rapid Firing Tactical Modules.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Marzio</span><br />
Its exceptional speed advantage makes it stand out among battleships. Based on the Machariel class, it is fitted with a special jump drive and a Covert Cynosural Field Generator, capable of detecting covert cynosural signatures and silently infiltrating enemy rear positions to carry out combat missions.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Annihilator</span><br />
Using the Vindicator as its base blueprint, the Serpentis has built a battleship with new materials, further reducing the negative effects of the Stasis Webifier on the ship and optimizing the capacitor for the warp drive. It can be fitted with Repair Tactical Modules.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Anubis</span><br />
The Mordu's Legion's advanced development of Target Painter technology is embodied in the Anubis. Its wide-area, efficient target marking capability enables the Anubis to perform precise long-range strikes on locked targets. It can be fitted with Sniper Tactical Modules.<br />
Note: Thanks to breakthroughs in new material technology and the nanocore design being the same as the prototype ship's structure, these ships can also use the prototype ship's nanocores (some nanocores are still incompatible for now, but they will be gradually compatible in the future).<br />
How to obtain: The ships can be manufactured based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering. The tactical modules can be purchased from Jita Market - Tactical Modules - Regular Tactical Modules tab.<br />
How to Obtain (Event): Can be purchased in the recommended Store as Opt Supply, limited to 1.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Opening of the Voyage Ceremony Event</span><br />

The gifts include Wang-Yue Battleship, Wang-Yue Ceremony Nanocore, Skill Points, Lazarus Unit, Insurance Points, ISK, and Nanocores.<br />
The Wang-Yue Battleship is a battleship with universal bonuses to all weapons, capable of considerable firepower output without requiring skill bonuses.<br />
The Wang-Yue Celebration Core also provides damage bonuses to shields and resistance bonuses to all shield damage attributes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Balance Adjustments</span><br />
All Cruisers and ships with a lower tonnage can now be piloted without any Tech Level restrictions. We will make more novice-friendly adjustments to skills, modules, and missions in the future.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Optimizations</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Increased the basic valuation of all Mission Assignments, and confirmation is now required when attempting to delete them.<br />
Increased the number of market orders for Filaments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Engine Update Event Now Live</span><br />
To ensure performance and stability over the long term and to more efficiently develop new content, we've launched an all-new client engine (improving the performance without affecting actual gameplay).<br />
