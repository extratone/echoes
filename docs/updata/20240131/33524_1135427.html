                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#FF8C00;">1/31/2024 at 08:00</span> (UTC+0) and will take approximately <span style="color:#FF8C00;">120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Content</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Dynamic Insurance Feature</span><br />
In order to improve the flow in capsuleer’s gameplay experience, reduce losses from destroyed advanced ships, and reduce the decline in demand due to over-filing of insurance claims, the following features are being introduced.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">1. Dynamic Insurance Pricing</span><br />
The starting claim prices for regular ships and capital ships are 30%/80%, respectively.<br />
Based on the number of claims the capsuleer has filed this month (calendar month) for a particular model of the ship, the price will increase by 10% for each claim filed, up to 100%, which resets on the first day of the following month.<br />
<br />
If a particular model of the ship has not been claimed for a while, the claim price for the ship will be reduced by 10% every month, down to a minimum of 20%/50%.<br />
<br />
There are no distinctions between models for modules, rigs, and nanocores, where only the three categories are tracked. Initially, they all start at 30%, which increases by 10% for each claim filed, up to 100%. It does not decrease over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">2. Other Insurance Discounts</span><br />
The Deposit Insurance Discount Plan has been removed. The discounted value (30%/80%) is now the default value, and no Insurance point deposit is required.<br />
The additional discount plan for the first two claims in Dormant Realm every week will be retained, and its discount percentage will remain the same as the current rates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">3. Ship Valuation Optimization</span><br />
With improvements in societal productivity, the benchmark for ship manufacturing materials has been lowered. After thorough research, the insurance company is introducing the following discount plan.<br />
<br />
The reference material efficiency used for ship valuations, previously ranging from 100-115% depending on material type, has been reduced to a fixed 100% for all materials. As a result, the insurance claim prices have been reduced too. After the update, claims filed for past orders will also enjoy the discounted price.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">4. Lock Time Optimization</span><br />
The 12-hour lock time for PvP claims now starts counting from the time the ship was destroyed.<br />
Removed the lock time for Nanocores.<br />
The maximum claim time has been adjusted from 2 months to 6 months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Thank you for your concern about the insurance system, capsuleers. Please refer to the community announcement for more details. We also have our attention on the issue regarding Gift Insurance Points and will introduce more optimization plans after the event has ended. We appreciate further relevant feedback on the matter. Let us work together to build a favorable economy together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">"Annihilator" Doomsday Weapon</span><br />
A super weapon that can fire an enormous energy beam after preheating, attacking all ships within the beam range and destroying their weapons, defenses, and engine systems. It is also known as the Disruptive Lance.<br />
<br />
Due to the need to control extremely high energy outputs, it can only be installed on Lancer Dreadnoughts that support this technology. Once fitted, it can enhance the firepower output of turrets and missiles. Only one of these can be fitted, and the ship can no longer cloak after fitting it.<br />
<br />
The key characteristics of each weapon are summarized below. Please refer to in-game descriptions for further details.<br />
<br />
-Divine Punishment EM Annihilator. More concentrated power for higher damage, but with a high consumption cost<br />
-Peregrine Kinetic Annihilator. Fast warm-up with a long beam duration<br />
-Inferno Thermal Annihilator. Large beam coverage with a long jamming time<br />
-Iron Hammer Explosion Annihilator. Low consumption cost with a fast restart speed<br />
<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering<br />
Once the event has started, capsuleers can check and purchase the bundle in Store -&gt; Bestseller Combo -&gt; Hot Selection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Lancer Dreadnought</span><br />
As the major empires conducted secret research into the doomsday weapons, "Reaper" and "Lance", advanced dreadnoughts capable of using the Disruptive Lance, a variant of the "Lance", also joined the R&amp;D program.<br />
<br />
The Lancer Dreadnought is used for tactical disruption of enemy capital ships in large-scale showdowns. It has a showdown mode that can enhance the Doomsday Weapon, and it is capable of withstanding burst firepower to a certain extent. Each one of them is jointly developed by several technology corporates.<br />
<br />
Karura, led in development by the Ishukone Corporation, is capable of using missiles and railguns.<br />
In addition to its lasers, Bane also utilizes missiles, a favorite among Khanid designers.<br />
Under the insistence of the drone giant Roden Shipyards, Hubris combines the small fighter launch bays with the railguns, allowing it to respond effectively to complex battlefield scenarios.<br />
Valravn once again demonstrates the renowned maneuverability and advanced repair system of Thukker.<br />
<br />
For the convenience of Capsuleers, CONCORD has issued temporary passes to these 4 ships. They are temporarily allowed to travel in High Sec before the maintenance on Mar 27 (UTC+0).<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering<br />
Once the event has started, capsuleers can check and purchase the bundle in Store -&gt; Bestseller Combo -&gt; Hot Selection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Dragon Chant Nanocore</span><br />
Dragon Dance: For the first time ever, Dragon Chant supports the customization of the color of the dragon scale special effects on ships. Furthermore, the entire series features a unique tail flame special effect.<br />
<br />
Dragon Roar: A unique mode of Dragon Chant, with a new effect of Locking disruption. Once the mode is enabled, the ship will instantly break away from being locked by all other ships, reducing its own Signature Radius while increasing firepower output. However, it Cannot Warp or it is incapacitated to use Cloaking Devices while in this mode.<br />
<br />
How to obtain: Redeem it from the Store with the event currency “Jade Dragon”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Balance Adjustments</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Ships</span><br />
Carriers. Removed the Command Burst Activation Time Bonus. Increased the Command Burst Strength from +1% to +2%<br />
Versatile Assault Ship. Initial Lightweight Destroyer Launch Bay +1. Changed the Shield Extender and Armor Plate Bonus from +10% per level to a fixed 50%, and it no longer enjoys skill bonuses<br />
Rorqual. New Bonus: Capable of launching Superheavy Logistic Drone<br />
All Capital Ships. Adjustments made such that they can no longer fit Entosis Link, and removed the Entosis Link time penalty<br />
CyanSea, with the rapid development of carrier technology, its research cost has also been reduced, and the number of blueprints required for reverse engineering has been reduced from 20 to 10</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">The Kalevala Expanse</span><br />
In order to improve the combat experience of capsuleers in the Kalevala Expanse Region and to improve combat fairness, the following adjustments are introduced.<br />
1. It is no longer possible to join a fleet in the Kalevala Expanse Region, but it is still possible to leave a fleet in the Region.<br />
2. In the Kalevala Expanse, only the fleet labels are shown, and the standing of contacts will no longer be visible.<br />
3. In the Wasteseeker Centrum, the Acceleration Gate can now only be activated once all Gate Securities are defeated.<br />
4. The rewards in the Loot Crate of the final room in the Wasteseeker Centrum have been increased.</span></p>
