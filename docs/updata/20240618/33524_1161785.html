                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">6/19/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0) </span></strong>and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Content</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Bomber Battleships</span><br />
The Bomber Battleship is a fortress on the battlefield. Although armed with a reduced number of turrets, each possesses exponentially increased firepower output. While maintaining the advantages of the original ship model, its defense systems and self-repair capabilities have been significantly enhanced.<br />
In addition, the ship is equipped with a new Missile Launcher Bomb that can precisely strike targets and unleash devastating area damage.<br />
Bomber Battleships can be equipped with Citadel modules, which greatly increase repair amount and electronic warfare resistance, but will no longer be able to warp.<br />
The first batch includes a total of 4 ships:<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Rokh Bomber</span><br />
Excels in using the railgun, with an excellent optimal range. It has high shield resistance and the capability to counter certain sensor dampening effects.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Abaddon Bomber</span><br />
Excels in using the laser, with high armor resistance and capacitor warfare resistance, greatly enhancing its endurance.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Hyperion Bomber</span><br />
Excels in using the railgun, with further enhancement in armor strength on top of the decent repair amount of its original ship model.<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Maelstrom Bomber</span><br />
Excels in using the cannon with a high rate of fire, improving its energy efficiency while reducing the power required for shield repairers.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering<br />
How to obtain (Limited Time): Obtain from the Event Manual</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Missile Launcher Bomb</span><br />
A launcher with a unique structure that allows it to launch powerful bombs using only a small amount of power. Its damage type can be changed by loading different types of bombs.<br />
Only ships that support Missile Launcher Bomb technology can be fitted with this module. After fitting, you must load bombs (ammunition) to be able to fire. If you unfit or replace the module, any loaded ammunition will be discarded.<br />
Firing requires preheating. After preheating is complete, a bomb will be launched towards the front of the ship. The bomb will automatically detonate after reaching its maximum flight time and cannot be manually detonated.<br />
Bombs will damage all ships, drones, and structures within range, including the launcher itself.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Bombs (Ammunition)</span><br />
Specialized ammunition for Missile Launcher Bombs, with different ammunition having different damage effects.<br />
Electron Bomb: Deals EM damage over a large area.<br />
Scorch Bomb: Deals thermal damage over a large area.<br />
Concussion Bomb: Deals kinetic damage over a large area.<br />
Shrapnel Bomb: Deals explosive damage over a large area.<br />
Void Bomb: Causes capacitor neutralization over a large area.<br />
Inferno Bomb: Deals multiple types of damage and causes capacitor neutralization over a small area.<br />
How to obtain (Type I): Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market<br />
How to obtain (Type II): Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the Underground Market with ISK<br />
How to obtain (Type III): Not available yet</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Termina Echo Nanocore</span><br />
The brand new "Termina Echo" series Nanocores have undergone a technological revolution using black hole observation data, allowing them to deflect and reduce incoming damage, which can be partially absorbed and converted into energy for their own use.<br />
Special Mode: Deflection Absorption. Upon activation, the mothership and its drones gain 20% resistance to all damage types and 20 Echo levels, lasting for 30 seconds, with a 300-second Cooldown Time. After the mode ends, the Nanocore will convert the absorbed energy in the fight for its own benefit.<br />
Echo Level: After the mode is activated, the ship will gain Echo levels based on hits received, starting at 20 levels and maxing out at 50 levels. Once the mode ends, the ship's firepower will be increased by 10% to 25%, and its flight velocity by 10% to 25% (effects also apply to drones) based on the number of levels. The buff lasts for 30 seconds.<br />
Gravity surges and time and space intertwine, weaving the silhouettes of you and me.<br />
How to obtain: Get them from the Store and Interstellar Bazaar event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New General Units</span><br />
Added 3 new General Units for Mothership Command Enhanced Module with the following effects:<br />
Command Enhancement Unit: Increasing the Mothership Command Module enhancement effect on Command Bursts, but reducing the enhancement effect on fighters.<br />
Output Enhancement Unit: Increasing the Mothership Command Module enhancement effect on fighters, but reducing the enhancement effect on the mothership.<br />
Flight Time Enhancement Unit: Reduces the restart time (by 30 seconds with V10.0), but also reduces the enhancement effect.<br />
How to obtain (Event): Obtain from General Units Box</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Skills</span><br />
Added 3 new skills that can be purchased and trained with ISK.<br />
Mothership Command Technology: The skill for operating the Enhanced Mothership Command Module. It can increase the module's activation time, reduce fuel consumption, and enhance the damage and speed bonus for fighters.<br />
Bomb Deployment Theory: The skill for operating Missile Launcher Bombs. It reduces the activation time and restart time of Missile Launcher Bombs.<br />
Ammunition Manufacture: Increases the efficiency of manufacturing various types of ammunition, such as Bombs, Missiles, and ammo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Balance Adjustments</span><br />
The equipment jamming effect of Support Projection Implants will not disable special modules (Networked Sensor, Logistic Support).<br />
Bomber Frigate III: Gains 1 additional special high slot for fitting the Missile Launcher Bomb. Increased ammo hold.<br />
The drop rate of fighter blueprints in the Capital Ship Nihilus Space has been reduced. Fixed an issue where blueprints for fighters of other factions were dropping. The overall yield has been lowered to normal levels.<br />
Structure module blueprints are now only sold by Jita ITC.</span></p>
