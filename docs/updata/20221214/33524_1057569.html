              <div class="artCon">
                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on </span><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">12/14/2022</span></strong></span><span style="font-size:18px;"> at 08:00 (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px;"><em><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Version: Assault</span></em></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">According to Scope, the Museum Arcana in Zimse was attacked, and the CONCORD technical experts reckon the Angel Cartel might have mastered a rigging technology for Assault Ships.<br />
According to certain sources, this technology originated from a search for ancient relics, and the museum attaches great importance to it. All clues have pointed to an undiscovered area on the boundary of the universe - the "Ember Sea".<br />
Lost technologies and the deep starry sky. The undercurrents surge in New Eden as the Yoiul Festival approaches. Only by chasing the light and continuously moving forward can you escape the vortex of age and emerge victorious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Versatile Assault Ship</span><br />
The Versatile Assault Ship is a frontline combat faction carrier modified based on the Imperial Carrier.<br />
Some technologies of the Imperial Dreadnought have been combined, modifications have been made to carrier hangars, command communications and power systems. Better ship protection has been implemented and control of lightweight Frigates and lightweight Destroyers has been achieved at the expense of Fighter control range.<br />
As a front-line combat Carrier, the Versatile Assault Ship can possess combat capabilities that are far superior to ordinary Carriers for a short time with the help of the Swarm Mothership Defense Module. In addition, they can even resist attacks from multiple battleships alone. However, they still cannot confront powerful Dreadnoughts head-on.<br />
How to obtain: Reverse engineer Carrier blueprints, then manufacture using regular Carrier and Capital Ship components.<br />
Main Characteristics:<br />
Anacoda: A Guristas faction Carrier with extra protection.<br />
Vassago: A faction Carrier from the Angel Cartel with the mobility bonus.<br />
Astartes: A faction Carrier from the Blood Raider Covenant with the bonus on Energy Neutralizer Electronic Warfare.<br />
Villain: A faction carrier from the Serpentis Corporation with the bonus on Webifier Electronic Warfare.<br />
Due to Lightweight Ships having a weapon system that is highly different from Fighters, and Versatile Assault Ships having a more complex structure, they cannot be fitted with Fighter rigs.<br />
Bombard Tactics and Automatic Defense Implants directly apply to the Capsuleers, and the technologies used by Lightweight Ships are mainly Drone technologies, so it also takes effect on Lightweight Ships operated by Capsuleers.<br />
Lightweight Ship Rigs and Versatile Assault Ship Nanocores will be launched soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Lightweight Ship</span><br />
Compared to the four empires which own large industries, the consumption of Fighters on Carriers puts a severe burden on the logistics systems of other factions.<br />
For better adaptation to drone combat, each faction has made modifications to Frigates and Destroyers (particularly their reliable and easy-to-manufacture features) to make them more lightweight and drone-friendly.<br />
Lightweight Ships use technologies that are different from those of Fighter Drones, so they cannot be fitted with the modules and use the skills of Fighter Drones.<br />
How to obtain: Reverse engineer Frigate blueprints or Destroyer blueprints, then manufacture using Frigate (or Destroyer) and modules.<br />
Main Characteristics:<br />
Lightweight Frigate: A modified Imperial Frigate with high mobility and low protection, its interceptor model has specialized electronic warfare capabilities and can be fitted with Warp Scramblers.<br />
Lightweight Destroyer: A modified Imperial Destroyer with high protection and stronger firepower. Its Offense model has enhanced protection and interception capabilities and can be fitted with Stasis Webifiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">AI Reverse Technology</span><br />
Several major corporations have successively started to invest in researching experimental AI blueprint-assisted design techniques. Their hope is to perform rapid reverse engineering, as well as designing more distinctive modules or ship structures.<br />
However, this reverse engineering technology has not been fully developed. The iterative AI algorithm may amplify the original manufacturing features or errors of Carriers during the process of reverse-engineering the scanned data, resulting in unpredictable design outcomes.<br />
Main Characteristics:<br />
When reverse-engineering one module blueprint, the Capsuleer might obtain one of the Module Blueprints due to different outcomes.<br />
This technology will be used for the first time for reverse engineering the Experimental Carrier Hangar Modification System. Capsuleers have a chance of obtaining one of the 6 Variant Blueprints after they start reverse engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><em><strong>New Modules</strong></em></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Swarm Mothership Defense Module</span><br />
A shield generation and damage control system that connects the mothership to the lightweight ship, so that some damage can be transferred to the mothership, greatly improving the performance of lightweight ships for a short time. Force closed when both the mothership Shield and Armor are destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Experimental Carrier Hangar Modification System</span><br />
Heavily modified structures inside the Carrier hull, allowing for more Versatile Assault Ships to be accommodated after fitting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Sentry Drone</span><br />
Sniper and Offense Sentry Drones have been added to the game. Sniper Drones are more accurate and effective against small targets, while Offense Drones have stronger firepower and are more effective against large targets.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained in Lv.9/Lv.10 Scout Cosmic Anomalies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Fighters</span><br />
Navy, Assault, and Offense Fighters have been added, including Space Superiority Fighters and Attack Fighters.<br />
Navy Fighters have more comprehensive abilities. Assault Fighters are faster and more accurate, but have a weaker defense and are highly suited to chasing down enemies. Offense Fighters have stronger firepower and defense, but are very slow and more suited to fighting large enemies.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained in Capital Ship Rift.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Showdown Mode</span><br />
To counter Frigates' interference with the attack capabilities of Dreadnoughts in electronic warfares, the scientific research institutions of various factions have conducted in-depth research on the conversion of electromagnetic field poles in Showdown Mode.<br />
Now, the Weapon Disruption and Sensor Dampening Resistance can be greatly improved in Showdown Mode. However, this also has a side effect on the ion force field, making remote repairs and capacitor transfers less effective.<br />
New Effects added in Showdown Mode:<br />
Weapon Disruption, Sensor Dampening, and Remote Repair Resistance +75%</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Cosmic Anomaly Adjustments</span><br />
New Fighter Blueprints have been added to the Loot Crates of Capital Ship Rift while retaining the old Logistic Drone Blueprints.<br />
New Drone Blueprints have been added to the Loot Crates of the Lv.9/Lv.10 Scout Cosmic Anomalies, including Assault, Sniper, and Offense, while retaining the old Logistic Drone Blueprints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Skills</span><br />
Versatile Attack Ship Operations: Improves the handling of Versatile Attack Ships.<br />
Versatile Assault Ship Defense Upgrade: Improves the defense of Versatile Attack Ships.<br />
Team Combat: Improves the performance of the Swarm Mothership Defense Module.<br />
Lightweight Ship Combat Theory: Improves the performance of Lightweight Ships.<br />
Guristas, Angel Cartel, Blood Raider, and Serpentis Capital Ship Invention Principles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><em><strong>NEW EVENT</strong></em></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Yoiul Festival: Light of the Ember Sea</span><br />
Event Duration: Dec 14, 2022 to Jan 14, 2023<br />
The Museum Arcana has been attacked by an Angel fleet, and some precious collections have been stolen. Meanwhile, Daniel, the curator of the museum, is deeply troubled. The leading figure of a mysterious faction "Yue" has appeared, gazing straight at the edge of the Universe - the "Ember Sea".<br />
During the event, Capsuleers can participate in the "Light of the Ember Sea" story on the event page. After completing this series of missions, Capsuleers can get stage rewards, and the final prize is the Museum Arcana Commemorative Medal.<br />
Capsuleers have a chance of obtaining Golden Age Clue Items after completing any of the missions. The chance of obtaining these in Super Expert difficulty is greater than that of Advanced difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Neon Peak</span><br />
Neon Peak is an event hosted by Caldari's CBD Group that seeks investment from Capsuleers to build a new commercial center. Capsuleers can invest in the construction by purchasing various Gift Boxes. After each successful Business Plan, the system will draw a lucky Capsuleer and grant them an additional gift.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Business Plan Store</span><br />
The Business Plan Store has been added to the New Eden Store. Capsuleers can exchange the Business Plan Points obtained in the Neon Peak for various rewards there. Make sure you exchange the points before the store closes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Classified III Gravitational Wave Graph</span><br />
To thank the Capsuleers for their participation in the Business Plan, CBD Group has provided the Classified III Gravitational Wave Graph as a redeemable item in the Business Plan Store.<br />
Item Introduction:<br />
After obtaining the Wave Graphs, Capsuleers can decrypt them in stations. According to the decrypted clues, they can navigate to hidden anomalies, and find and open the Loot Crates there.<br />
At the anomalies, Capsuleers might discover 3 Gravitational Rift Spaces, which can accommodate Frigates, Cruisers, and Batterships.<br />
Please note that there may be multiple Rift Spaces connected to each other. The other spaces are more dangerous than the first "Quiet Rift Space", and all Capsuleers can check the locations of the dangerous Rift Spaces in their regions on their Star Charts.<br />
Defeat the enemies in the Rift Spaces and open the Loot Crates for a chance to obtain items such as Rigging Experiment Data (such as Missiles, Shields, and Hangar Rigs), Salvagers, Salvaged Materials, and Drone Blueprints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Golden Age Restart</span><br />
Event Duration: Dec 14, 2022 to Jan 11, 2023<br />
To read, approve, record, and find a smooth path to the future from the splintered past is the main goal of research collections.<br />
During the event, Capsuleers can collect collections and combine them to get Planning Points after combining the correct story images.<br />
Extra Planning Points can be obtained by combining all story images. Please claim them within the exchange period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Inscription of the Galaxy: Heaven</span><br />
Event Duration: Dec 14, 2022 to Feb 15, 2023<br />
Measure heaven beyond the universe. The new season, Heaven, is about to kick off. Please view the in-game event description for more details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">CONCORD Pass</span><br />
Pass Duration: Dec 16, 2022 to Jan 27, 2023<br />
CONCORD Pass Season 14 will be updated on Dec 16, 2022. New content has been added to this update:<br />
The Dark Halo Faction Lucky Chest is now available in the CONCORD Pass Shop. Purchase it to get all kinds of materials as well as a chance to get Dark Halo Nanocore Opt Supplies for Faction Battleships, etc.<br />
Exile and Ascension Nanocores are available for exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><em><strong>Optimizations</strong></em></span><br />
1. The estimated price has been updated based on the market transaction record.<br />
2. Fighter rigs can now only be fitted on Chimera and other regular Carriers.<br />
3. Adjusted the altitude distribution of ore in the Capital Ship Rift so that they don't block horizontal movements.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><em><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></em></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">1. Fixed an issue where the Skill Remote Armor Operation was effective on Capital Ship Modules.<br />
2. Fixed a display error of the Tracking Computer's Tips.<br />
3. Fixed an issue where the time of Reverse Engineering was sometimes incorrectly displayed.<br />
4. Corrected the description of the Golden Age Nanocore by replacing "Sun Chaser System" with "Jump Drive." Note: the change does not affect the function of the Nanocore.</span></p>
