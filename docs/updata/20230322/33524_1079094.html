                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong>3/22/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0) </strong>and will take approximately <strong>120 minutes</strong> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content</strong><br />
Specific Skills</span><br />
In response to the threat of an unknown faction, a category of CONCORD-approved special skills are available for Capsuleers to learn.<br />
Compared to comprehensive skills that can improve multiple abilities, these skills are very specific, generally improving only one ability, and not by much, but are more versatile.<br />
These skills can improve damage, range, and tracking velocity, as well as strengthen the shield, armor and increase ore mining yield. They can also enhance a wide range of special abilities.<br />
<em><strong>Introduction of Selected Skills:</strong></em><br />
Target Navigation Prediction, focusing on attacking fast targets, makes all missiles less prone to damage reduction when doing so.<br />
Precision Guidance Theory, increasing the damage of all missiles against small targets, making them less vulnerable to damage reduction.<br />
Controlled Bursts Theory, reducing Capacitor Need of all turrets.<br />
Drone Interfacing Theory, increasing the drone control range.<br />
Fighter Fighting Theory , increasing the Explosion Velocity of all fighter rockets.<br />
Lightweight Ship Navigation Theory, increasing the Flight Velocity of all lightweight ships.<br />
Shield (Armor) Hardening Array Theory, increasing the base value of Shields (Armor) for all capital ships.<br />
Damage Transfer Theory, increasing the Damage Transfer Ratio of Mothership Defense Modules.<br />
Mothership Defense Coordination Theory, reducing the Restart Time of Mothership Defense Modules and improving durability.<br />
<em><strong>How to obtain:</strong></em><br />
Common skills can be purchased and trained directly by spending ISK.<br />
Advanced skills can be obtained by purchasing supply chests from the CONCORD Pass Shop. During the event, these skills can be purchased from the Awakened Land Store.<br />
Expert Skills are manufactured based on the chip blueprints obtained in Deadspace and some materials from the Scout Cosmic Anomalies.<br />
<em><strong>CONCORD suggests:</strong></em><br />
Comprehensive skills are much more practical than specific skills. Capsuleers should prioritize training the former, then the latter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Intelligent Nanocore</span><br />
To save Yaoshi, the former guardian of civilization who followed her to New Eden, Yue works closely with SoCT researchers to develop a new nanocore for ships that can store consciousness.<br />
They took the nanobot technology originally installed on the ship and improved it by reconfiguring its framework, adding a central processor to the components to manage the operation of each nanobot under the nanocore system, and implanting Yaoshi's consciousness into it.<br />
<em><strong>Expansion:</strong></em><br />
With the guidance intelligence, the nanobots can optimize their layout patterns by themselves, allowing the nanocore to expand by itself, thus saving space for more nanocore entries to be fitted.<br />
<em><strong>Unlocking entries and analyzing nanocores:</strong></em><br />
The expanded nanocore can fit an additional main entry, and can still obtain more sub-entry slots through upgrades.<br />
Subentries of an intelligent nanocore must be obtained by analyzing other nanocores.<br />
<em><strong>Unlock AI access:</strong></em><br />
This technology is still in beta. The SoCT researchers hope to make the consciousness of Yaoshi available to all Capsuleers to access so that they can gather more experimental data and explore ways to implant more consciousness.<br />
When implanted in the consciousness center, the expanded nanocore can transmit its consciousness to any nanobot, allowing it to operate any electronic device on the ship and even temporarily control the ship for the player.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Balance Adjustments</span><br />
Mothership Defense Module<br />
The calculation for its damage bonus has been adjusted to be the same as common modules and rigs, and its restart time has been reduced by 60 seconds.<br />
Anomaly<br />
Scout Cosmic Anomaly: Added skill neurons to the Loot Crates, which can be used to manufacture skill chips.<br />
Deadspace: Added skill chip blueprints to the Loot Crates, which can be used to manufacture expert skill chips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Dormant Realm Adjustments</span><br />
Leaderboard Rewards will be adjusted as follows:<br />
The rewards for the top 10 will be changed from 36 Ascension Neural Compilers and 72 Genesis Neural Compilers to 18 Ascension Neural Compilers, 18 Ascension Neural Compilers (Clone Bound), 36 Genesis Neural Compilers, and 36 Genesis Neural Compilers (Clone Bound).<br />
The rewards for positions 11 to 50 will be changed from 18 Ascension Neural Compilers and 36 Genesis Neural Compilers to 9 Ascension Neural Compilers, 9 Ascension Neural Compilers (Clone Bound), 18 Genesis Neural Compilers, and 18 Genesis Neural Compilers (Clone Bound).<br />
The rewards for positions 51 to 100 will be changed from 9 Ascension Neural Compilers and 18 Genesis Neural Compilers to 5 Ascension Neural Compilers, 4 Ascension Neural Compilers (Clone Bound), 9 Genesis Neural Compilers, and 9 Genesis Neural Compilers (Clone Bound).<br />
The rewards for positions 101 to 200 will be changed from 9 Genesis Neural Compilers to 5 Genesis Neural Compilers and 4 Genesis Neural Compilers (Clone Bound).</span></p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><em><strong>Note: After maintenance, when previously acquired rewards are opened, Capsuleers will get the clone-bound items according to the new rules.</strong></em></p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Nanocore Lucky Chest</span><br />
The Nanocore Lucky Chest is available in the Store. Use the Decoding Key to open it. You will be granted a Battleship Nanocore Opt Box within 60 times.<br />
After that, the Nanocore Lucky Chest will keep rotating to match the current theme, allowing all Capsuleers to exchange for the Nanocore of their choice.<br />
The Decoding Key can be purchased through the Store or exchanged in the CONCORD Pass Shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>NEW EVENT</strong><br />
Awakening Iron Rain</span><br />
The new event - Awakening Iron Rain is upon you. Event Duration: Mar 22, 2023 8:00 to Apr 5, 2023 8:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Sleepers are ancient beings who disappeared thousands of years ago and left behind some traces of their existence. Now, they're calling out to New Eden. In the face of an approaching threat, the leaders of New Eden are in a heated debate over what to do next.<br />
<em><strong>Faction Conflict:</strong></em><br />
The leaders of New Eden have reached an impasse over how to deal with the threat from sleepers. Former comrades are divided and turning against each other.<br />
Learn about the factional disputes among New Eden leaders through Epic Arc Missions. Capsuleers will choose the faction they side with to complete Request Missions, help New Eden resist sleepers and increase faction support to receive event rewards.<br />
<em><strong>Awakened Land:</strong></em><br />
Capsuleers will enter the Awakened Land in space during the event to fight against sleepers. Complete corresponding missions to get mission rewards and event tokens.<br />
In Cosmic Anomalies, participating in "Proficiency" means collecting data and obtaining Science Credits. For "Alien Visitors", Capsuleers need to defeat Sleepers.<br />
<em><strong>Leaderboard:</strong></em><br />
During the event, the total number of points earned by Capsuleers in Proficiency and Alien Visitors will be calculated daily. The top 20 Capsuleers on the server will be added to the leaderboard. Capsuleers with the same score will be ranked according to who earns the points faster.<br />
Rewards will be mailed to ranked Capsuleers the next day.<br />
<em><strong>Awakening Iron Rain Store:</strong></em><br />
Offers a wealth of items such as Skill Points, materials, Nanocores, Classified III Gravitational Wave Graphs, etc.<br />
Please check the Awakening Iron Rain Event page for more information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Project Pirate</span><br />
Event Duration: Mar 22, 2023 8:00 to Apr 5, 2023 8:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Under the invisible threat of an unknown faction from an anonymous region, several mega corporations are scrambling to develop new modules and prepare for release. Success depends on the security of the trading route. To that end, these corporations have launched a series of reward events aimed at pirates to ward off potential hazards.<br />
During the event:<br />
Planetary Extraction Speed +50%<br />
Loot from Pirates +25%<br />
More orders for the sale of PLEX and the purchase of items will be generated when the insurance claims are settled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Navigator Program</span><br />
Event Duration: Mar 22, 2023 8:00 to Apr 10, 2023 8:00 (UTC+0)<br />
The Navigator Program is on again! Top up a total of 499 AUR to start a new round of monthly Skill Points replenishment. Top up to a certain amount of AUR for additional rewards. Please refer to the in-game descriptions for details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Optimizations</span></strong><br />
1. The estimated price has been updated based on the market transaction record.<br />
2. In Corporation Clash, more options for the number of in-battlefield Capsuleers have been added: 10, 20 and 30.<br />
3. Added Ship Tonnage Restrictions in Corporation Clash. Capsuleers can choose the maximum tonnage allowed to enter the battlefield when initiating a Clash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></span><br />
1. Fixed the issue where Lightweight Ships using turrets were doing less damage than than they are supposed to.<br />
2. Fixed the lagging where mining failed in some rare cases.<br />
3. Fixed the issue where the market price limit didn't apply when modifying the price.</span></p>
