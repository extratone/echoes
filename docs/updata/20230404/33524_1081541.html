                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on<strong> 4/05/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</strong> and will take approximately <strong>120 minutes</strong> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content</strong><br />
Noctis II</span><br />
The Noctis II introduced by ORE is a modified version of the Noctis with a focus on cargo capacity.<br />
This ship sacrifices most of its Shield Emitters to greatly increase the cargo capacity and gain the ability to control Salvage Drones.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Industrial Core Module</span><br />
A small industrial core module introduced by ORE that can be fitted to the Orca.<br />
Once activated, it can increase drone controls and the ship's shield boost ability, as well as the ability to compress ores in its cargo hold.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Signal Amplifier</span><br />
An enhancement set that can increase sensor strength and scan resolution, perfect for Electronic Warfare ships specializing in disruption, and can be used as ECM defense modules in special operations.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased in the CONCORD Pass Shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">General Fire-control System</span><br />
An integrated fire control system suitable for Versatile Assault Ships, capable of enhancing the offensive capabilities of lightweight ships across the board.<br />
The experimental device introduces various technologies for weapons to improve performance, such as Heat Sinks, Gyrostabilizers, and Tracking Computers, which are effective for all types of lightweight ships.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased in the CONCORD Pass Shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Nanocore Exchange</span><br />
As the nanocore data becomes more comprehensive, CONCORD has authorized the exchange of Nanocores from the "Clear Sky" and "Neon Gas" series.<br />
Compressed Nanites can be obtained by purchasing Omega, etc. Rules for exchanging Nanocores are the same as before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Balance Adjustment</strong><br />
Ships</span><br />
Newly-added Bonus for Orca: Industrial Modules can be fitted.<br />
For RorquaI, Inertia Modifier reduced by 0.01. Newly-added Bonus: Exhumer Technology, each level increases exhumer yield by 5%.<br />
Dominix II Drone Damage raised to 50%.<br />
Rattlesnake Drone Damage raised to 475%.<br />
Nestor Drone Damage raised to 75%.<br />
Turret and Missile Damage for Praxis and Praxis II raised to 50%, Drone Damage for them raised to 100%.<br />
Apocalypse Striker Damage Bonus reduced to 7%.<br />
Added: Fuel Tank for Versatile Assault Ships.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Modules</span><br />
For Capital Armor Repairer, Armor Repair Amount reduced by 25%, Capacitor Need reduced by 25% and Activation Time reduced by 37.5%.<br />
Lowered the reduction penalty for Capital Energy Nosferatu and Capital Energy Neutralizer against small ships.<br />
Increased damage by 10% for Capital Long-range Turret and Missile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Drones</span><br />
Adjusted the Damage and Tracking Velocity of non-Sentry combat drones to reflect the differences between empires.<br />
Gallente Drone Damage increased by 15%.<br />
Caldari Drone Damage increased by 10%.<br />
Amarr Drone Damage increased by 5%.<br />
Small Drone Optimal Range increased by 1.2 km.<br />
Medium Drone Tracking Velocity increased by 40%.<br />
Large Drone Tracking Velocity increased by 30%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Lightweight Ships</span><br />
The damage done by Lightweight Frigates using turrets has been increased to equal those using missiles.<br />
For Lightweight Frigates, Turret Tracking Velocity increased by 25%, Missile Explosion Velocity increased by 25%.<br />
For Bombard Lightweight Frigates, Missile Explosion Radius reduced by 25%.<br />
Increased Weapon Tracking Velocity and Explosion Velocity for Light Destroyers to be the same as Light Frigates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Logistics Adjustments</span><br />
To improve drone efficiency and reduce waiting time, we have reduced the activation time of all Logistic Drones to 4 seconds.<br />
In response to the change in activation time, we have improved the recovery of Logistic Drones and re-matched the bonuses for Minokawa and Apostle.<br />
Increased the recovery of Logistic Drones to half that of Remote Repair Modules under the same category.<br />
Raised the Repair Effectiveness to the same level for the same Metalevel Capital Remote Shield Booster, Repair Effectiveness increased by 2% - 10%, Optimal Range increased to 10 km and Accuracy Falloff increased to 15 km.<br />
For Capital Remote Armor Repairer, Repair Effectiveness increased by 10%, Capacitor Need reduced by 7.5%, Optimal Range increased to 18km and Accuracy Falloff increased to 6km.<br />
For Minokawa, Logistic Drone Shield Repair Effectiveness raised to 55%, Remote Shield Booster Effect raised to 20%.<br />
For Apostle, Logistic Drone Armor Repair Effectiveness raised to 55%, Remote Armor Repairer Effectiveness raised to 20%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Attribute Bonus Adjustments</span><br />
For Targeting System Subcontroller, the calculation for its attribute bonus has been adjusted to the standard stacking method for common rigs. The percentage will be calculated according to the base value instead of the current value.<br />
Currently, modules and rigs with the Flight Velocity Bonus don't have a reduced effect when stacking attributes. According to the item's description and setting, this attribute should exhibit a loss in performance when stacking.<br />
After the adjustment, a reduced effect will occur when 3 or more modules or rigs with Velocity Bonus are fitted.<br />
Affected rigs and modules include: Hydraulic Bay Thruster, Drone Flight Accelerator, Fighter Flight Accelerator, Auxiliary Thruster, Missile Guidance Enhancer, Drone Navigation Computer and Fighter Microwarpdrive Guide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Implants</span><br />
High Power Coil<br />
Retardant Coil: Changed Kinetic Damage penalty to decrease with level, reduced to 33% at full level.<br />
Thermal Circulation<br />
Thermal Damage: Thermal Damage: Overheat damage bonus now increases with level, up to 390%.<br />
Barrage Repression<br />
Suppressive Fire: Velocity decrease effect raised to 25%, the Deceleration time, Duration, Cooldown Time and Durability Consumption reduced by 33% accordingly, 1 Cannon ammo is loaded immediately after use.<br />
Support Projection<br />
The jamming success rate is now affected by the sensor strength of the ships on both sides; the success rate is higher against enemies with low sensor strength, and is reduced when they have significantly higher sensor strength.<br />
The jamming success rate or resistance can be enhanced by fitting modules such as Signal Amplifiers.<br />
Electronic Jamming Warhead, damage penalty reduced to 30%.<br />
Newly-added Effect for Dreadnought Siege Mode: Sensor Strength +100%.<br />
Sensor strength for all capital ships is displayed in ship TIPS. The Caldari State has the highest Sensor Strength due to its exceptional ability in electronic jamming.<br />
Focused Crystal<br />
The Focused Crystal is perfect for fast weapons due to its unique mechanics, not so much for slow, less accurate weapons. Its maximum damage is high, causing massive losses when it misses the target. So we made the following adjustments to make it usable on more ships.<br />
Focus Effect: Reduced the damage bonus per level to 1.5%, each attack gains 2.4 Focus effect levels.<br />
Rapid Charge: Each attack gains 3.6 Focus effect levels.<br />
Crystal Reinforcing: Optimized the growth curve, so that the Reinforcing effect will immediately take effect after selecting this (up to 80 layers at level 45).<br />
Crystal Stimulation: Cooldown Time reduced by 30 seconds.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Damage Immunity Adjustment</strong></span><br />
Adjusted the basic combat mechanics so the calculation will not be triggered when hitting a target immune to damage (such as Stargates and ores). Effects based on damage calculation will not be consumed or stacked.<br />
Affected Implants include: Barrage Repression, High Power Coil, Focused Crystal, Bombard Tactics and Automatic Defense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Corporation Tax Adjustment</strong></span><br />
If the Corporation tax rate is &gt;10%, charge only 10% tax to Corporation Members if their Tech Level is &lt;= 7.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>NEW Events</strong><br />
Lazarus Unit Gift</span><br />
In order to help Capsuleers train skills at will, during the event, when your Tech Level reaches the requirement you can claim up to 10M Lazarus Units.<br />
Event Ends: May 31</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Battle of Hunters</span><br />
Battle of Hunters will reopen after maintenance, which includes Lucky Nugoeihuvi Draw and The Hunt.<br />
Event Duration: Apr 5, 2023 8:00 to Apr 19, 2023 8:00 (UTC+0)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Monthly Gifts of AUR</span><br />
Additional AUR will be gifted when you buy AUR for the first time every month after maintenance, the amount of AUR varies based on different purchase options. Offer refresh time: First day of each month.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></span><br />
1. New buttons have been added to Skill TIPS for quicker access to the Industry and Market screens.<br />
2. Fixed the issue where general Turret and Missile skill bonuses didn't take effect on lightweight ships.<br />
3. The particle energy stream in the Dormant Realm has become more unstable. It now deals a high amount of damage per second when Capsuleers are near the border, so please try to avoid going there if possible.<br />
Fixed the issue where Capsuleers would sometimes get stuck in the preparation screen and not be able to enter the Dormant Realm.</span></p>
