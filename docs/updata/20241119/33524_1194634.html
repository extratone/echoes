                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">11/20/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0) </span></strong>and will take approximately <span style="color:#f39c12;">120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Content</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Capital Damage Control</span><br />
Damage Control for Capital Ships, specially optimized for X-Large hulls. This model of Damage Control can be reused, providing higher resistance when not activated. When activated, the resistance boost is lower than the Basic model, but the activation time is longer.<br />
In addition to the basic model, Amarr and Gallente have also launched their own versions of it:<br />
Basic Capital Damage Control, lasts for 30 seconds. The unactivated resistance bonus is about twice that of Damage Control (note that this is not an Emergency Hull Energizer, and only the Vassago's Damage Control Activation Time bonus will be applicable among all Capital Ships).<br />
Imperial Navy Capital Damage Control. The higher the energy requirements, the stronger the resistance.<br />
Federation Navy Capital Damage Control, with a longer duration and restart time.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Starbreak Nanocore</span><br />
The brand new "Starbreak" series Nanocores. Reforge the stars with molten strikes. They can store and convert part of the dissipated energy from combat to repair the system and restore the shield and armor.<br />
The Specialized Mode can be stored 3 times, after enabling:<br />
· Increases its own Shield/Armor Max Limit by 30% and immediately restores Shield/Armor equal to 30% of current Shield/Armor Max Limit.<br />
· Increases all Weapons and Drone Damage by 15%.<br />
Note: The higher value between the ship's Armor and Shield determines whether Armor or Shield will be restored.<br />
How to obtain: Get them from the Store, Interstellar Bazaar, and Region Development events.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Lightweight Ship</span><br />
New Assault, Integrated, and Augmented Lightweight Destroyers have been added. Thanks to the new materials, these models of Lightweight Ships have higher overall performance.<br />
Assault. Focuses more on flight velocity, weapon range, and Stasis Webifier than on defense, with slightly lower firepower compared to Offense.<br />
Integrated. Thanks to the addition of new materials and drone components, this model excels in various aspects, such as speed, weapon range, and fire control.<br />
Augmented. Further improved on the basis of the Integrated model, with extremely strong overall performance.<br />
How to obtain:<br />
How to obtain: Assault. Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.<br />
Integrated and Augmented. Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained from the Loot Crates in Wasteseeker Capital Cosmic Anomalies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Rigs</span><br />
Added rigs for cargo ships and logistic drones.<br />
Navigation Rigs: Mineral Hold Optimization and Structure Hold Optimization (Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering)<br />
Drone Rigs: Drone Shield Recharge Stabilizer, Drone Shield Recharge Augmentor, Drone Armor Repair Stabilizer, and Drone Armor Repair Augmentor (Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained from the Loot Crates in Wasteseeker Capital Cosmic Anomalies)<br />
(These 4 types of Drone Rigs are effective for both Large Logistic Drones and Superheavy Logistic Drones)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Portrait Experience</span><br />
It's time to experience new faces. A total of 160 new Character images have been added for the various races of the four major Empires.<br />
During the event, Capsuleers can change their portrait for free once on the Event Page - New Portrait Experience.<br />
Subsequently, you can change it in the Character Interface - Edit Info.</span></p>

In all Nihilus Spaces, when moving within the Nihilus Well, gains a 30-second Lock Protection status, which disappears after moving or using any module.<br />
Capital Proving Grounds and Unknown Hidden Rifts. Removed ores from Dangerous Deposits, and now loading and flying will proceed more smoothly. Added Skill Chip Blueprints to Loot Crates.<br />
The discovery rate of all Capital Cosmic Anomalies has been increased by 4.2%. The effect of the number of destroyed anomalies on the discovery rate has been reduced (lower Monday discovery rate and more even distribution).<br />
Capital Ship Quarry. The chance of obtaining an ORE Data Compiler from the wreck of a destroyed Rorqual has been increased by 50% (compared to the original chance).<br />
Wasteseeker Gravitational Wave Graph. The chance of obtaining Integrated and Augmented Drone/Fighter Blueprints has been increased by 10%.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Ships</span><br />

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Construction</span><br />
Added new Data Compilers from the four major Empires for Reverse Engineering of some Empire module blueprints. Market Transactions for them are not yet available, but they can be purchased from the Militia Store.<br />
All Test and Upgraded Modules can now be Reprocessed. After Reprocessing, a small amount of the four major Empires' Data Compilers and Device Construction Units can be obtained.<br />
All Stations now support the compression of Pyerite into its high-density form.<br />
Offensive Lightweight Destroyer. While maintaining a similar overall value, adjusted the manufacturing blueprint: Device Construction Unit -3.2%. Small Device Improvement Medium -22.5%. Manufacturing Cost increased by 12 million. New Material Requirements: Navigation Experiment Data x8, Rigging Experiment Data x24.<br />
Lightweight Destroyer (Standard). While maintaining a similar overall value, adjusted the manufacturing blueprint: Device Construction Unit -10%. Small Device Improvement Medium -28%. Manufacturing Cost increased by 10 million. New Material Requirements: Navigation Experiment Data x5, Rigging Experiment Data x10.<br />
