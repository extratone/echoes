                  <p>To New Eden Capsuleers,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>5/7/2025 at 08:00</strong></span> (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Malpais<br />
Region Briefing</strong></span><br />
With further exploration of regions like Cobalt Edge, more remote and dangerous systems frequented by Wasteseekers have been discovered—Malpais.<br />
The Malpais Region consists of 15 Constellations, with a total of 102 Systems, all of which have a security level assessment of below 0.<br />
This region is controlled by "Wasteseeker Drones," with Wasteseeker Centrums, Wasteseeker Encampments, unexplored Relics, and weakened Wasteseeker gathering points scattered throughout.<br />
Scout reports indicate that the regular Wasteseekers in Malpais appear weaker than those in other areas and do not carry warp disruption modules.<br />
Capsuleers can use Spatial Rift Filaments to construct routes to enter or leave Malpais.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Constellation Distribution</strong></span><br />
The Stargates leading to the outside regions from Malpais have been cut off, the systems within the region are not fully connected, and can be roughly divided into western constellations, southern constellations, and northern constellations, a total of 3 areas.<br />
Main Enemy Distribution<br />
Western Constellations: Medium and Small Wasteseeker fleets, with only Battlecruisers and smaller-tonnage ships allowed entry.<br />
Southern Constellations: Medium and Large Wasteseeker fleets, with only Battleships and smaller-tonnage ships allowed entry.<br />
Northern Constellations: The main enemies are Small Wasteseeker fleets, with only Destroyers and smaller-tonnage ships allowed entry.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Weakened Wasteseeker Gathering Points</strong></span><br />
Scouts have observed damaged Wasteseekers gathering in special Cosmic Anomalies. These Wasteseekers are weaker in combat, and the anomalies contain abundant loot.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Special Mechanisms</strong></span><br />
Corrosive Dust<br />
Due to the presence of large amounts of corrosive dust within the region, prolonged exposure to the Malpais Region will cause damage to ships. If a ship remains in the Malpais Region for more than 1 hour, it will suffer continuous damage until it exits the domain.<br />
Under the influence of corrosive dust, the energy consumption of optical refraction systems increases significantly, and the fuel consumption rate of stealth modules rises tenfold.</p>

<p>High-Activity System Alert<br />
When Wasteseeker Cosmic Anomalies within the system are destroyed at high frequency, the pulses generated by frequent Wasteseeker fleet explosions will cause the system to be highlighted on the radar starmap.<br />
Starmap data resets every hour.</p>

<p>Wasteseeker Bounty Reward<br />
Due to the high risks involved when capsuleers carry high-value materials while exploring the Malpais Region, CONCORD will assess the value of materials in the ship hold and increase the Wasteseeker bounty reward accordingly. The value of materials will exclude Pinpoint Fibers during calculation.<br />
The bounty bonus rewards are divided into seven tiers.</p>

<p>Wasteseeker Research Data<br />
Destroying Wasteseekers in the Malpais Region may result in the drop of various levels of Wasteseeker research data. Capsuleers can bring these back to the station for use, earning varying amounts of LP or merit points as rewards.<br />
Note: If capsuleers carry this item in their ship's cargo hold and the ship is destroyed in the Malpais Region, the item may be lost.</p>

<p>Structure Info<br />
Due to the unique environment of the system, the Malpais Region is currently completely controlled by Wasteseeker Drones. Trailblazers have not established a station, and capsuleers cannot anchor any structures.</p>

<p>System Broadcast<br />
The Malpais Region does not have a broadcast management center, so it is impossible to view online capsuleers, and the local population is displayed as ?.<br />
Capsuleers cannot obtain standings, they can only recognize fleet members and contacts, all other individuals will not display standings.<br />
Capsuleers may choose to broadcast their local messages so that other capsuleers in the current system can receive them, but doing so will reveal their presence.</p>

<p>Ore Resources<br />
Its ore distribution is similar to that of the Asteroid Belt in the Kalevala Expanse, with gas cloud C70 being a currently popular resource.</p>

<p>Planetary Resources<br />
The planetary resources of the Malpais Region do not significantly differ from those found in other regions within New Eden.<br />
Due to the high difficulty of leaving the region and the inability to anchor structures, this region is currently unsuitable as a regular location for Planetary Resources Harvesting.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Spatial Rift Filaments</strong></span><br />
"Expedition" Spatial Rift Filament<br />
Small "Expedition: Malpais Region-4" Spatial Rift Fiber: Supports up to 4 players teaming up to explore the northern constellation of the Malpais Region.<br />
Medium "Expedition: Malpais Region-4" Spatial Rift Fiber: Supports up to 4 players teaming up to explore the western constellation of the Malpais Region.<br />
Large "Expedition: Malpais Region-4" Spatial Rift Filament: Supports up to 4 players teaming up to travel to the southern Constellation of the Malpais Region<br />
How to obtain: Purchase from the market.</p>

<p>"Homeward" Spatial Rift Filament<br />
When creating a channel to the Malpais Region, if the value of the materials carried by the Capsuleer is too high, the ship's Inventory will trigger spatial anomalies, causing the System signal to be monitored and marked, and broadcasted to the local channel. During construction, the value of the Homeward Rift Filament itself will be ignored.<br />
"Homeward: Malpais Region-1" Spatial Rift Filament<br />
Returns to a random low-security System within the Empire Faction's territory, can only be used near a star, has a low alarm Threshold, and a short construction time. How to obtain: Acquired by destroying Wasteseeker Drones in the Malpais Region<br />
"Homeward: Malpais Region-1" Spatial Rift Filament II<br />
Returns to a random low-security System within the Empire Faction's territory, has a medium alarm Threshold, and a medium construction time. How to obtain: Acquired by destroying Wasteseeker Drones in the Malpais Region<br />
"Homeward: Malpais Region-1" Spatial Rift Filament III<br />
Returns to the System where the Expedition Rift Filament was used, has a high alarm Threshold, and a long construction time. How to obtain: Purchased from the market</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Version Preview: Target Analyzer</strong></span><br />
Release Time: After maintenance on May 21<br />
Three types are available this time, each with three models. How to obtain:<br />
Experimental: Purchased from the LP store<br />
Scholar: Dropped randomly by destroying Wasteseeker Drones in the Malpais Region<br />
SoE: Blueprint dropped randomly by destroying Wasteseeker Drones in the Malpais Region, manufactured using the blueprint</p>

<p>Target Module Analyzer<br />
When destroying a target, it increases the likelihood of its installed modules dropping. This model's effect cannot stack and is determined by the final blow.</p>

<p>Target Cargo Analyzer<br />
When destroying a target, it increases the likelihood of items in its cargo hold dropping. This model's effect cannot stack and is determined by the final blow.</p>

<p>Target Structure Analyzer<br />
When destroying a target, it increases the likelihood of leaving behind a Wreck. This model's effect cannot stack and is determined by the final blow.</p>

<p>New Event Encounters<br />
Duration: May 8, 2025, 8:00:00 ~ May 22, 2025, 8:00:00（UTC+0）<br />
Starry Night Voyage: Mountain and Sea Encounters Missions<br />
During the event, tasks can be refreshed on the Encounters Bulletin Board, with 3 difficulty levels and 4 tasks available.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Insurance Updates</strong></span><br />
To improve the Capsuleer experience, simplify insurance rules, encourage market activity, boost market demand, minimize unnecessary delays after ship destruction, and reduce the impact of consecutive ship losses, CONCORD has partnered with insurance companies to implement several significant updates to the insurance mechanism.<br />
Insurance Cost Calculation<br />
Distinctions between different ships, modules, rigs, and Nanocores will no longer apply. Instead, upon ship destruction, calculations will be made as follows:<br />
Regular Ship Premium = Fixed at 30%<br />
Capital Ship Premium = 50% - Number of Capital Ships Destroyed Within 30 Days x 5%, with a minimum of 35%<br />
Supercapital Ship Premium = 50% - Number of Supercapital Ships Destroyed Within 30 Days x 10%, with a minimum of 40%<br />
After the adjustment, Capsuleers no longer need to wait for 3 months and can make claims at any time (with a 12-hour lock period for PvP).<br />
To boost market demand and promote healthy economic development, we will gradually phase out claim discounts for lower-priced ships, weapons, modules, and rigs based on insurance claim data in the future.<br />
For example, low-tier weapons or rigs priced under 1 million ISK have low usage rates, low claim costs, and low market demand. A 30% premium would further weaken their market demand, reducing item value. Removing the discount will not significantly increase the burden on Capsuleers but will boost market demand, making items easier to trade.</p>

<p>Special Battlefield Insurance Costs<br />
Currently, in special battlefields such as the Dormant Realm and CyanSea Vault, different insurance rules are applied. After the update, insurance discounts for CyanSea Vault and Relics skirmishes will be removed, leaving only the Dormant Realm insurance discount. Detailed rules are as follows (discount rates remain unchanged):<br />
For ships destroyed in the Dormant Realm, an additional discount will be applied based on the total number of ship losses this week:<br />
For the first destruction each week, the insurance premium will be set at 33% of the normal value.<br />
For the second destruction each week, the insurance premium will be set at 66% of the normal value.<br />
For the third destruction and beyond, the insurance premium will be charged as normal.</p>

<p>Special Ship Insurance Costs<br />
Currently, CONCORD ships enjoy additional insurance discounts. These discounts apply only to ships and not to the modules installed on them. The specifics are as follows:<br />
Regular CONCORD ships (such as Marshal) have an insurance premium rate of 60% of the standard value.<br />
CONCORD Capital Ships (CyanSea) have an insurance premium rate of 80% of the standard value.<br />
This feature has not been changed and is for your information only.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Premium Acquisition</strong></span><br />
When a claim is made, if a certain item has many unfulfilled insurance acquisition orders, the premium acquisition is triggered:<br />
New Acquisition Price = Insurance Pricing x (100% - 150%)<br />
The specific price depends on the number of backlogged orders. The more unfulfilled orders, the higher the premium.<br />
For example:<br />
Across the universe, multiple players claim insurance for a certain module, with an insurance acquisition price of 2 million ISK, while the market price for this module is around 2.3 million ISK. This leads to backlogged orders that are difficult to fulfill. When these unfulfilled orders expire, the 2 million acquisition cost will be refunded to the insurance pool for this module.<br />
When the backlog reaches 10 orders (example figure), the next claim order will acquire the item at 2.2 million ISK, and the insurance pool will simultaneously deduct 2.2 million ISK.<br />
If the transaction still cannot be completed, when the backlog of orders reaches 15 (example number), the next compensation order will purchase at 2.4 million. At this point, the system will automatically purchase modules listed on the market for 2.3 million, and the successfully purchased modules will be destroyed after the transaction is completed.<br />
Note that the market transaction price is determined by the earliest listed order. For example, if a Capsuleer lists a sale order at 2.3 million first, and the insurance company attempts to purchase at 2.4 million, the actual transaction price will be 2.3 million.</p>

<p>Sun Chaser Navigation System Update<br />
With the phased advancements in Yan-Jung technology and Structure jump drive technology, the Sun Chaser Navigation System has also undergone a major update.</p>

<p>Sun Chaser Engine Operation Method<br />
When piloting a ship equipped with the Sun Chaser Navigation System, open the Star Charts, select a system, and click the [Jump to System] button in the system menu to activate the Sun Chaser Engine.<br />
After the Sun Chaser Engine is activated, it requires a warm-up period. Once the warm-up is complete, it will attempt to jump to the vicinity of the target system's star.<br />
During the warm-up phase, normal flight and combat are possible, but actions such as crossing stargates, warping, docking, and jumping will interrupt the warm-up process.</p>

<p>Jump Conditions<br />
In addition to general requirements such as fuel, capacitor, and warp stability, the following three conditions must also be met:<br />
1. Cannot jump from a null-sec system to the Empire's territory (high-sec and low-sec).<br />
2. The target system must not have a Jammer Tower.<br />
3. The security level of the target system must not be lower than 0.<br />
Technicians are analyzing data from all null-sec systems to research the technology for activating the Sun Chaser Engine in null-sec systems. In the future, it may be possible to activate the Sun Chaser Navigation System in null-sec systems and jump to the target system without a Force Field.</p>

<p>Changes in Sun Chaser Engine Technology<br />
The old engine could only jump to a few ITC systems or request jumps to systems where teammates were located, which was inconvenient. The new engine can jump to the vicinity of any star within range. After opening the Star Charts and selecting the "Induction Beacon" option, the jump range of the Sun Chaser Engine can be viewed.<br />
The old engine caused significant fatigue after jumping, whereas the new engine results in fatigue levels similar to those of a standard jump drive.<br />
The navigation range of the new engine's solar pursuit is 3 light-years, differing from the navigation range of a standard jump drive.<br />
The old engine does not require preheating. The new engine requires preheating to allow the navigation system to locate the target System and initiate a jump without induction. The preheating time is 120 to 240 seconds, and there are currently no trainable skills available.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Balance Updates</strong></span><br />
Ships<br />
The jump range of Force Auxiliary and Versatile Assault Ships has been increased from a base of 3.5 light-years to 4 light-years.<br />
The Lucent-Moon class shield resistance bonus has been adjusted to its base value, no longer requiring skills (making it easier to participate in combat outside of logistics).<br />
Bombardment battleships have had their mass increased by approximately 5% and their effective defense increased by approximately 20%.<br />
Nightmare class: +1 low slot, Powergrid +12%.<br />
The Interdictor class and three other Advanced Tactical Destroyers: +1 low slot, effective defense increased by approximately 11%, Powergrid +10%.<br />
Garmur class: Scan Resolution +10%, Signature Radius -6.2%.<br />
Orthrus class: Scan Resolution +7.7%, Signature Radius -4.4%.<br />
Barghest class: Signature Radius -6.7%.</p>

<p>Modules<br />
Yan-Jung armor system reconfiguration: Shield value and shield resistance adjusted from -20% to -25%, armor value and armor resistance adjusted from +20% to +25%.<br />
Yan-Jung Remote Armor system reconfiguration: Drone armor repair amount increased from +500% to +600%, shield value adjusted from -20% to -25%, armor value adjusted from +20% to +25%.<br />
Yan-Jung shield system reconfiguration: Shield value increased from +20% to +25%, armor value adjusted from -20% to -25%.</p>

<p>Missiles and Mordu's Legion ships<br />
To enhance missile tracking capabilities against high-speed targets and reduce damage delays in ultra-long-range combat, the following adjustments have been made to missile velocity:<br />
Small missiles and medium rapid missiles: Damage +2.9%, theoretical range adjusted from 3.75s * 4000m/s to 3s * 5000m/s.<br />
Small Torpedo, Damage +5.5%, theoretical range increased from 2.2s * 2500m/s to 2s * 3000m/s<br />
Medium Missile, theoretical range increased from 6.2s * 4500m/s to 5.2s * 5400m/s<br />
Medium Torpedo, theoretical range increased from 3.6s * 2500m/s to 3s * 3000m/s<br />
Large Rapid Missile, Damage +5%, theoretical range increased from 6.2s * 4500m/s to 5.2s * 5400m/s<br />
Large Missile, Damage +5.1%, explosion velocity increased from 90 to 95, theoretical range adjusted from 12s * 6000m/s to 10s * 7200m/s<br />
Large Torpedo, Damage +6.7%, explosion velocity increased from 95 to 100, theoretical range adjusted from 6s * 3000m/s to 4.5s * 4000m/s<br />
Capital Ship Missile, Damage +4.2%, explosion velocity increased from 56 to 70, explosion radius reduced from 6500 to 6000<br />
Capital Ship Torpedo, explosion velocity increased from 40 to 50, explosion radius reduced from 10000 to 8000, theoretical range increased from 7s * 5500m/s to 6.5s * 6000m/s<br />
Capital Ship Dual Torpedo, Damage +5.2%, explosion velocity increased from 95 to 100</p>

<p>After the above adjustments are implemented, missiles will be more effective at pursuing high-speed targets. However, since missiles require time to accelerate (typically less than 0.5 seconds to reach maximum flight speed), this may result in significant range loss during shorter flight times. Therefore, adjustments to Mordu's Legion ships are necessary to ensure their range remains consistent or slightly improved:<br />
Garmur, Orthrus, and Barghest: missile flight time adjustment from -50% to -40%, missile flight speed adjustment to +150%</p>

<p>Construction<br />
When manufacturing items, the minimum material efficiency is set at 75% (to avoid issues caused by abnormally low material efficiency).</p>

<p>Implants<br />
When installing the Implant endurance adjustment unit to enable a module to operate continuously, you must first deactivate the module before switching the Implant.</p>

<p>Cosmic Anomaly<br />
In Systems within the Azure Vault Region that lack Sovereignty Structures, Wasteseeker siege Bases will not appear. The probability of encountering Elites in siege Bases has been increased.<br />
Encounter refresh time has been reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes, concurrently lowering the probability of two laboratory tasks appearing.<br />
In Relic skirmishes, the firepower and disruption capabilities of Wasteseeker enemies have been reduced, significantly speeding up the process of collecting data to earn LP.<br />
[Magnetic] Gravity Trap Capturer has been adjusted from requiring construction and a 7-day wait after activation to being constructible once per week, with completion taking approximately 15 minutes and no waiting required.<br />
[Mineral] Gravity Trap Capturer has been adjusted from requiring construction and a 2-day wait after activation to being constructible three times per week, with completion taking approximately 15 minutes and no waiting required.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Optimization and Fixes</strong></span><br />
Nanocore Collection Optimization<br />
Optimized the extraction experience for the Nanocore Collection by standardizing the packaging of Nanocores for ships of different tonnages. Capsuleers can obtain corresponding tonnage Opt Supply and choose as needed.<br />
After 60 draws, you are guaranteed to receive Thermomagnetic Storm &amp; Dark Halo Opt Supply (Battleship), and the guaranteed count will not reset.</p>

<p>Optimizations<br />
The Lucent-Moon class now supports AI Core upgrades, and the Sleeper Core for the Enforcer class also supports AI Core upgrades.<br />
The Bonus for the refresh rate of Capital Ship-level Cosmic Anomalies has been adjusted to reset every Saturday.</p>

<p>Bug Fixes<br />
Fixed an issue where Navy Issue Carriers could enter certain standard Sleeper Sanctuaries.</p>
