                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong>6/7/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</strong> and will take approximately <strong>120 minutes</strong> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content</strong><br />
Supercarrier</span><br />
When people set foot on the land of New Eden and started a new life, the supercarrier development project has already started. They are the backbone of various empires' fleets.<br />
As the threat from the unknown force intensified, CONCORD has made available the manufacture of the four supercarriers and their related modules.<br />
<strong>Wyvern</strong><br />
Where Wyvern's fighters fall short in damage, they excel in attack accuracy, defense, and flight velocity. With assistance from a powerful radar disruption burst, they can exert precision strikes at the enemy.<br />
The carrier itself possesses an extremely potent shield resistance and shield hitpoints, capable of taking heavy firepower with the support of the logistics.<br />
<strong>Hel</strong><br />
Hel boasts the greatest fighter damage of all, and thus, quickly delivering significant damage to enemies has become a key design goal for it.<br />
Hel's fighters are fast-moving, and the carrier itself is similarly swift. It excels at directly attacking quick enemies and utilizes the engine disruption burst to slow enemies down.<br />
<strong>Aeon</strong><br />
Aeon is the representative of Amarr Empire’s “steady and robust” ships. It boasts the longest fighter range, the best fighter firing precision, and the strongest fighter defense, making it a formidable opponent against any enemy.<br />
In addition to its powerful fighters, Aeon also has the best defense itself. When using its power disruption burst, Aeon is capable of neutralizing a large amount of power in multiple targets, further reinforcing Aeon’s survivability on the battlefield.<br />
<strong>Nyx</strong><br />
Nyx's firepower is almost as potent as Hel, yet it differs from Hel in its fighters, where they boast greater firing range and defense. Plus, they also excel in reducing their own signature radius, making it harder for enemies to lock onto them.<br />
While Nyx may fall off against high-speed targets compared to Hel, it can deal significant damage to enemies with its powerful defense disruption burst. Understanding how to evade the defense disruption is crucial in countering Nyx.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">How to obtain:<br />
Reverse engineer blueprints, data, and damaged hull, and manufacture using capital ship components and advanced components.<br />
The research on supercarriers has garnered intense interest, with active participation from various factions and powers. Capsuleers can obtain advanced components from various means.<br />
Primary sources: Obtain Advanced Component Transport Containers from destroying Capital Ship Rally Point, Capital Ship Special Fleet, and Unknown Capital Ship Rift. Open them to get Advanced Components and Fighter Blueprints.<br />
Challenge sources: Obtain plenty of components, modules, and intact fighters by destroying Pirate NPCs’ supercarriers<br />
Secondary sources: Obtain Component Transport Containers from Gravitational Wave Graph and open them for Advanced Components. Use a Decryption Key to open them for more components<br />
Limited-Time sources: Advanced Component Transport Containers are available for a limited time at the Mall, priced at 250,000,000 ISK each and with a max purchase limit of 50</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Notes:<br />
Due to their supermassive size, supercarriers can only be manufactured and docked at large Corporation Citadels and Interstellar Trading Centers (FTC), with the exception of High-Sec areas.<br />
While supercarriers are powerful, they are also easily spotted and besieged by enemies. CONCORD suggests Capsuleers should pilot them only when there is adequate support.<br />
Ongoing research:<br />
Due to the requirements of galactic warfare, various factions are pressured to accelerate the research and manufacturing processes for supercarriers. Currently, there is still room for improvement in the design of the supercarrier blueprint, and its high cost of production has limited the overall combat capability of New Eden.<br />
Currently, major factions are scrambling to develop the Supercapital Assembling Array, an Add-on Structure that can reduce the material cost for all capital ships for Sovereign Corporations.<br />
In addition, industrial process optimization for capital ship components with huge demand has been put on the agenda, which will reduce the ISK cost of producing capital ship components in the future and further enhance the overall combat capability of New Eden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Skills</strong></span><br />
Supercarriers share high similarities with regular carriers, so all skills that apply to the operation of regular carriers will apply to supercarriers.<br />
Further, you will need to receive training for more special skills to pilot a supercarrier perfectly, such as:<br />
Heavy Fighter Operation, Heavy Fighter Upgrade, Supercarrier Cover Module Operation, Power Disruption Burst Projector Operation, and other skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Heavy Fighter</strong></span><br />
Heavy Fighters are offense fighters exclusive to supercarriers. They possess strong attack and defense capabilities, and their heavy fighter rocket can deal significant damage to capital ships, but they are not suited to be deployed against non-capital ships.<br />
The following four models will be made available first: Malleus, Mantis, Cyclops, and Tyrfing.<br />
How to obtain: Purchase the MK9 Blueprint from Jita or obtain advanced blueprints from various capital ship cosmic anomaly and manufacture using ores</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Supercarrier Cover Module</span></strong><br />
To enhance the support capability of supercarriers to a fleet, Supercarrier Cover Module was developed.<br />
The module connects the Supercarrier to its nearby fleet (squad) members’ defense system and Power System via remote energy transfer technology, allowing the carrier to supply fleet members with energy and comprehensive repair. Further, it is capable of transferring some of the damage taken to the Supercarrier.<br />
The development of the cover module made reference to the tech used in force auxiliary, range revival module, defensive force field, and armor link module, which show a different effect than simply stacking the referenced modules.<br />
The damage transfer effect will not be effective on targets with an active defensive force field.<br />
The cover module is significantly more potent than the armor link module and will, therefore, override it, but its effect will diminish on massive ships.<br />
The restoration effect stacks with the range revival module and will not affect each other.<br />
&nbsp;But beware, the cover module will be forced to close and restart once the shield and armor of the carrier drop below the defense threshold and will not be able to activate when there’s an insufficient defense<br />
How to obtain: Reverse engineer materials such as experiment data, and manufacture it</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Capital Emergency Hull Energizer</span></strong><br />
In the prior engagements with the unknown force, CONCORD became aware of the inadequacy of New Eden’s defense capability and took the lead in researching ways to enhance the defense of capital ships.<br />
Through extensive research and trials on various ship structures, a damage control module that can comprehensively enhance the defense of ships was developed.<br />
It is a customized explosive module that utilizes a combination of containment field emitters and EM hull hardeners. While not active, it behaves like an enhanced damage control module.<br />
Once activated, the module will release all of its energy and greatly enhance the structure resistance of the ship for a short period of time, buying time for ally reinforcement or the final decisive battle.<br />
But beware, the module will be destroyed after activation, and all its active and passive bonus effects will be lost.<br />
Currently, there’s no way to repair the module yet. Capsuleers may only return to the Station, dissemble and reprocess it for other uses.<br />
How to obtain: Reverse engineer materials such as experiment data and damaged ship hulls, and manufacture it</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Burst Projectors</span></strong><br />
A tactical module specifically designed for supercarriers. Select a target, start preheating, and launch it. On a successful hit, project a burst centered at the target, causing potent disruption to the target and all units within a certain range.<br />
The burst does not cause disruption to the projecting unit. The closer it is to the center, the stronger the effect. If there are an extreme number of targets within the explosion range, the outer targets will not be affected by it.<br />
The following six burst projectors will be made available first:<br />
Energy disruption, which can neutralize targets’ power.<br />
Weapon disruption, which can reduce targets’ artillery range and precision.<br />
Radar disruption, which can reduce targets’ scan resolution, increase their signature radius, and reduce their missile range and precision.<br />
Engine disruption, which can reduce targets’ speed and warp stability, and increase their inertia.<br />
Power disruption, which can reduce targets’ capacitor limit and increase their capacitor recharge time.<br />
Defense disruption, which can reduce targets’ defense.<br />
How to obtain: Reverse engineer data to obtain the blueprint and manufacture it</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Capital Ship Trial Field</span></strong><br />
From now on, when destroyed various cosmic anomalies in the nullsec zone, Capsuleers may find a hidden Capital Ship Trial Field of the major pirate forces.<br />
The concealment measure of the Trial Field will be rendered ineffective once it is discovered. All of its entrance will be exposed, and it will become visible on the Star Charts.<br />
The Capital Ship Trial Field is designed specifically for large-scale capital ship research and development trials. It contains a large number of partially improved capital ships and even supercarriers, with only a few regular ships for maneuvering support.<br />
The formation size of the Capital Ship Trial Field is not particularly large and is even smaller than a typical capital ship rally point, but its firepower is extremely powerful. CONCORD recommends that Capsuleers thoroughly prepare themselves before forming a fleet and taking on the trial field.<br />
Loots: All types of Advanced Components, new modules, fighters, damaged ship hull, and bounty</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Cosmic Anomaly Adjustments</span></strong><br />
From now on, it is possible to obtain Advanced Component Transport Containers from Capital Ship Rally Point, Capital Ship Special Fleet, Unknown Capital Ship Rift, and Unknown Hidden Rift (Wave Graph).<br />
The transport container is very valuable, and you can receive items such as Advanced Component, Ship Upgrade &amp; Modification Data, Hanger Upgrade &amp; Modification Data by opening it directly. You may receive more items by using a key to open it, as it protects the integrity of the data inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Balance adjustment</strong></span><br />
Added a unique bonus to Versatile Assault Ships: Raised the activation time of Capital Emergency Hull Energizer by 120s.<br />
Added a unique bonus to Guard Rorqual: Raised the activation time of Capital Emergency Hull Energizer by 180s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>NEW EVENT</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Supercarrier Manufacturing Contest</span><br />
To reward Capsuleers and Corporations for their efforts in manufacturing supercarriers and improving the combat capability of New Eden, CONCORD is hosting the Supercarrier Manufacturing Contest for them.<br />
During the event: 7 June - 2 August (after maintenance)<br />
Event rules:<br />
During the event, all Corporations and individuals who’ve successfully started a supercarrier manufacturing job will receive a reward based on their rankings. Further, the manufacturer will receive a basic reward for each supercarrier manufactured.<br />
The ranking will be automatically updated once the manufacturing job has started, and submission of the item is not required. The leaderboard will be updated twice a week and will not be updated in real-time.<br />
Primary rewards: Various Supercarrier Medals, new modules, and fighter blueprints. As the rules and rewards are intricate, please refer to the event page on the official website for details<br />
Notes: If Capsuleers wish to refrain from the leaderboard, you may contact Customer Support to voluntarily withdraw from it. You may conceal your real strength this way, but you will also forfeit the bonus rewards</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Optimizations</strong></span><br />
Valuation updated based on the market transaction record.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></span><br />
Fixed an issue where a weapon timer was still created after turning off Command Burst.</span></p>
