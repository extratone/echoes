                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">4/24/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0) </span></strong>and will take approximately <strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">120 minutes</span></strong> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Upgrade of Skill Chip Manufacture Process<br />
With the help of many Capsuleers, researchers have made some progress in improving the manufacturing process of skill chips. It now sees improvements in the following aspects:<br />
Expert Chip Manufacture skill's Material Efficiency bonus has been increased from 10% to 20%<br />
The amount of Nanites required to manufacture skill chips has been lowered by 33%<br />
The cost of manufacturing skill chips has been increased from 25,000,000 ISK to 200,000,000 ISK<br />
In addition, researchers are testing the use of the General Data Bank and Experimental Data to replace the specialization models to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce time costs. Once completed, it will further improve the convenience of skill chip manufacturing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Upgrade of Advanced Ship Reverse Engineering Technology</span><br />
As advanced ships such as navy issue and ops battleships become more popular, these ships' reverse engineering technology and manufacturing process have also undergone major upgrades.<br />
Adjustment of reverse engineering material requirements for navy issue frigate blueprints, advanced faction cruiser blueprints, and navy issue and ops battleship blueprints:<br />
Increase in the number of Ship Experimental Data, Datacores, and ISK required. Change to the number of basic ship blueprints selection, where it is no longer fixed and can be freely adjusted. Ship Damaged Hulls are no longer required. Slightly increase in the prices for blueprint reverse engineering<br />
Compared with the old blueprint, the manufacturing material requirements for the new blueprint have changed as follows:<br />
Increase in the number of ISK required. Decrease in the number of Minerals and Planetary Materials required. Increase in the number of Reaction Materials required<br />
According to the current material valuation and fluctuation range, the total shipbuilding cost is reduced to below 10 billion for battleships, 5 billion for cruisers, and 1.5 billion for frigates<br />
In addition to the above conventional ships, the reverse engineering technology for the CyanSea ships has also been upgraded again, with the detailed adjustments as follows:<br />
Decrease in the number of carrier blueprints required from 10 for each type to 5. Increase the ISK required to 500 million. Change to the basic material required from 20 Hangar Modification Data to 100 Capital Ship Upgrade Modification Data. Ship Damaged Hulls and Quantum Physics Datacores are no longer required. Decrease in the total shipbuilding cost for the blueprint</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Dominix Navy Issue</span><br />
In order to deal with enemies with high mobility and complex fleet composition such as the Wasteseeker Drones, the Federation Navy has opened up the manufacture license for Dominix Navy Issue Battleship.<br />
This model is based on Dominix II and, in addition to its basic characteristics, incorporates the strengths of Navy Issue: strong resistance, rapid locking, and strong sensor strength.<br />
Dominix Navy Issue is not wielded with the siege mode. Instead, it converts some of its high slots into mid slots to match the flexible combat characteristics of drones.<br />
Researchers are developing a unique combat module suitable for the Dominix Navy Issue. This mid-slot module can switch drones to attack mode when activated.<br />
Further, in an effort to increase the convenience of ship rigging and adaptability to diverse battlefield environments, researchers across nations are rebuilding the ship mode system. In the future, the inherent mode of the ship will be progressively replaced with various combat modules in the future.<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Manufacture them via reverse engineering. Its cost will be the same as the new manufacture cost of other Navy Issue Battleships<br />
How to obtain (Event): Obtain 1 from the Event Manual</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Venture Covert Ops</span><br />
Derived from the Venture IV, this ship is specifically designed for engaging in the most dangerous yet most lucrative mining businesses.<br />
Venture Covert Ops has exceptional speed and agility and is equipped with an advanced asteroid mining system. It is also the first mining ship to take advantage of Covert Ops Cloaking Devices, allowing it to warp while cloaked for movement to and from asteroid fields in even the most hostile territories.<br />
Please note that the Venture Covert Ops supports covert operations technology and can install a Covert Cynosural Field Generator. When discovering one of these ships, a timely response is crucial.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them via reverse engineering</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Dreadnought Fire-control Reinforcement System</span><br />
A fire-control reinforcement system designed specifically to increase the offense capability of Dreadnoughts. It re-prioritizes energy from defense and auxiliary power systems to boost the weapon system's output through improved fuel supply and a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts.<br />
This greatly enhances the ship's damage output while also seeing an increase in its weapon range and accuracy. However, it severely reduces the ship's repair capabilities. Carefully analyzing the combat situation is necessary to determine the optimal time to activate this system.<br />
Please note: This system is installed in the mid-slot, and only one can be installed. Once activated, it will continue to operate. Deactivation will not take effect immediately, but it will shut down only after the current cycle of operation is completed.<br />
How to obtain (Limited Time): Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased in the CONCORD Pass Shop<br />
As the major faction stores are still in the early stages of preparation, the CONCORD Pass Shop has re-listed the Swarm General Fire-control System Blueprint and the Basic Signal Amplifier Blueprint. The required CONCORD Pass points remain unchanged. Please feel free to go and make your purchase if necessary, Capsuleers. The items will be available until the end of June</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Adjustments to Wave Graph</span><br />
Increased the drop rate of Skill Chips and other module blueprints in the Wasteseeker series Wave Graphs by approximately 50%<br />
Increased the drop rate of Decryptors and Experiment Data in the Classified series Wave Graphs by approximately 50%<br />
(Note: Since many types of items are available and each drop rate is different, not all of them will be listed here in detail. The number in the announcement refers to the relative increase ratios, such as 2% -&gt; 3% or 20% -&gt; 30%, both of which would be referred to as an "increase by 50%")</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Delivery Center Opening Notice</span><br />
The delivery centers of the major empire stations have been completed and are undergoing security testing. They are expected to be opened on a limited basis after the maintenance on May 8.<br />
At present, only 4 Lancer Dreadnoughts and Versatile Assault Ships are allowed to be delivered from any high-sec system to one of the 6 low-sec ITCs, and more delivery permits will be opened in the future.<br />
The Lancer Dreadnought high-sec permit originally scheduled to expire on April 24 has been extended to May 8.<br />
Please note that delivering ships across regions to dozens of light years away requires a huge amount of fuel and maintenance costs. At the current level of technology, it will cost billions of ISK to complete. Capsuleers are advised to pilot the aforementioned ships out of high-sec systems as soon as possible.</span></p>
