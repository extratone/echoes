                Patch Notes - Nov 16
                  <p class="date">2022-11-16</p>
              </div>
              <div class="artCon">
                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>11/16/2022 at 08:00</strong></span> (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">Balance Adjustments</span></strong></em></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Ships</span></strong><br />
Mordu's Legion Ship Flight Velocity increased by 15%.<br />
Angel Ship Flight Velocity increased by 5%.<br />
Raised the Special Cargo Hold Capacity for Amarr and Minmatar industrial ships.<br />
Increased the Fuel Compartment Hold Capacity on all ships by 4 times.<br />
Cruiser II has two new single-attribute resistance bonuses of 15% and 25%, respectively. Types of resistance vary due to the different technologies each Faction is capable of.<br />
Barghest Missile Explosion Velocity raised to 7.5%.<br />
Enhanced versatility on Nestor ships, added Armor Link Module and Logistic Drone Bonus, the total amount of other bonuses remains unchanged, and the bonus skills are re-matched.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Ship Modes</strong></span><br />
Under Sniper Mode, added 25% Scan Resolution, ship velocity penalty decreased to 90%, raised Drone Control Range to 125%.<br />
Originally designed to attack immovable Structures and extremely slow Capital Ships, Siege mode should be a low-precision, high-damage assault. As a result, the Range and Explosion Radius penalties have been reduced, making them more in line with its core features. Adjustments are as follows：<br />
Explosion Radius penalty has been reduced to 100%. New bonus： Missile Velocity reduced by 10%, same with the turret range.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Weapons</span></strong><br />

Increased Capital Missile Launcher Damage by 5%.<br />
Increased Capital Beam Laser Damage by 10%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Defense Modules</span></strong><br />
Repair amount, Activation Time and Capacitor Need for Small Shield Boosters increased by 100% accordingly.<br />
Repair amount, Activation Time and Capacitor Need for Medium Shield Boosters increased by 66.7% accordingly.<br />
Reduced Capital Shield Booster Repair Amount by 5% and Capacitor Need by 2.5%.<br />
Reduced Medium Armor Repairer Repair Amount and Activation Time by 16.7% and Capacitor Need by 10%.<br />
Repair Amount, Activation Time and Capacitor Need for Large Armor Repairers reduced by 20% accordingly.<br />

Increased Large Armor Link Module Range to 30km, changed Damage Transfer to 80%, Self Armor Resistance increased by 9% upon activation.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Other Modules</span></strong><br />
Increased Small Energy Neutralizer Capacitor Need by 20%.<br />
Reduced Medium Energy Neutralizer Capacitor Need by 10%.<br />
Reduced Large Energy Neutralizer Capacitor Need by 5%.<br />
Removed Explosion Radius and Explosion Velocity Bonus for Omnidirectional Tracking Link, gain 1/3 of its effect when not activated.<br />
Drone Navigation Computer acceleration effect raised by 100%, gain 1/16 of its effect when not activated.<br />
Reduced Flight Velocity Bonus for Fighter Microwarpdrive Guide to around 250%, Signal Radius Penalty changed to 250%, gain 1/24 of its effect when not activated.<br />
Large Microwarpdrive, which currently has an anomalous Capacitor Need lower than the Afterbuner, hence the following adjustment： Increased the Capacitor Need by 50%, which is 10% higher than the Large Afterburner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Drones</span></strong><br />
Current features for Drones are high in Flight Velocity, low in Orbiting Speed, and Weapon Tracking Velocity, which performs as follows in battle：<br />
Out of Range - High-speed Tracking - Slow Orbit - Out of Range - High-speed Tracking… (loop)<br />
This allowed Drones to actually do far less damage than they are supposed to, thus increasing the Tracking Velocity and decreasing the Flight Velocity in general.<br />
Relevant Adjustments：<br />
Increased Small Drone Tracking Velocity by 200% and reduces its Flight Velocity by 50%.<br />
Increased Medium Drone Tracking Velocity by 150% and reduces its Flight Velocity by 30%<br />
Increased Large Drone Tracking Velocity by 100% and reduces its Flight Velocity by 10%<br />
The orbiting speed for the Fighter is increased to the same as its Flight Velocity (due to the specialized nature of the Fighter Heavy Rocket, it does not need to slow down for aiming during combat)<br />
Other Adjustments：<br />
Sentry Drone EHP raised by 50%.<br />
Changed Optimal Range for Large, Medium and Small Drones to 4.8 / 4.8 / 2.4km.<br />
Curator Optimal Range increased by 6km, increased Accuracy Falloff by 4km and Tracking Velocity increased by 0.01.<br />
Guard Optimal Range increased by 12km, and Tracking Velocity raised by 0.0084.<br />
Templar Damage increased by 3.7%.<br />
Einherji Damage increased by 4.8%, Accuracy Falloff reduced to 5km.<br />
Acolyth, Warrior, flight velocity -5%<br />
Infiltrator, Valkyrie, flight velocity -10%<br />
Praetor, Berserker, flight velocity -10%</span></p>

Thermal Circulation：<br />
Precision Calibration and Range increased by 25%.<br />
Sniping Technology：<br />
Basic Activation Time changed from 60s to 90s.<br />
Optimal Range and Accuracy Falloff for Remote Tracking increased by 7.5%.<br />
Bombard Tactics：<br />
Bomb Hardpoint Optimization replaced with guided bombing. No need to return to the carrier. You can guide bombs in space and perform Bombard Tactics. Due to bomb installation propulsion and guidance devices, the damage bonus is reduced to 150%.<br />
Flight Velocity for Micro Thrusters, Drones and Fighters reduced to 25%.<br />
Increased Evasive Maneuvers and Flight Velocity by 200%.<br />
Remote Shield：<br />
Adjusted Capacitor Need to -90% upon activation.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Laboratory Encounters</strong></span><br />
As experimentation of new module advances, pirate activity is beginning to increase. It'll be easier for capsuleers to find new missions now.<br />
The amount of bounty, loot and Rigging Experiment Data obtained from repelling pirates will also increase.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><em>New Content</em></strong></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Nanocore Showroom</span><br />
The nanocore display area has received an update. Now, on the "Customize Ship Appearance" interface, you can access a showroom with a huge curtain wall that offers a great view of outer space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Cyberx Nanocore</span><br />
The "Cyberx" nanocore makes its debut in New Eden with its futuristic and mechanical aesthetics. Thanks to the nanobots' smart utilization of the ship's interface, more slots have been opened up on any given ship.<br />
Delve deep into the heart of your ship. Experience the power of the Interstellar Bazaar's most precise and sophisticated design yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Login Rewards Update</span><br />
With the rise of productivity across New Eden, CONCORD has opted to remove prototype modules and trial SKINs while adding more practical reward items such as Lazarus Units.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">LP Store Update</span><br />
The LP Store plays a very important role in capsuleer training. As the Sleeper threat continues to grow, CONCORD has authorized access to more items.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Assault Drones</span><br />
These drones are used in assault operations. They have high flight velocity, long weapon range, and great accuracy, but have weak defenses. They're suited for circling or chasing down enemy capsuleers at range, and are an effective counter to anti-drone pulse bombs.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Offense Drones</span><br />
These are heavy drones designed to attack targets at close range. They have low weapon range, high attack power, and relatively good defense, which makes them an ideal choice if you want more firepower. However, their low flight velocity renders them powerless against fast targets and makes them easy prey for large enemy ships.<br />
These drones also come in small, medium and large sizes. You can exchange their blueprints at the LP Store to manufacture them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Anti-Drone Pulse Bomb</span><br />
Faced with the growing threat of drones, researchers at New Eden have developed a new weapon. It can disrupt the communication channels of surrounding drones, causing them to overheat and damaging their circuits.<br />
Due to the high energy cost, this type of weapon can only be fitted on a high slot. They're usually used by battleships. Please note that these weapons impact any drones indiscriminately, so exercise caution when friendly drones are nearby.<br />
You can exchange their blueprints at the LP Store to manufacture them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Nanocore Supply Chest</span><br />
To make it easier for capsuleers to get their desired nanocores, CONCORD has removed the original nanocores and loaded them into supply chests for capsuleers to choose from.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><em><strong>NEW EVENT</strong></em></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Support Strategy Capital Ship Manufacturing Contest</span><br />
Support Strategy Capital Ship Manufacturing Contest Winners<br />
The winners of the Capital Ship Manufacturing Contest have been decided. CONCORD will publish their names during UTC+0： 11/16/2022 8：00 - 11/23/2022 8：00. We will verify the data during the publication period and issue rewards after it has ended. Please remember to check for your reward.&nbsp;<br />
