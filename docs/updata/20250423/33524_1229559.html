EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on<span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong> 4/23/2025 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</strong></span> and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Content</strong></span><br />
<strong>Navy Issue Carrier</strong><br />
With the deployment of new Dreadnoughts and battleships in active combat, the Imperial Navy has issued a tender for a next-generation carrier. The design must incorporate defensive and support capabilities, enabling it to serve as the central defense unit of a small mixed fleet while also integrating seamlessly into capital ship formations for medium- to large-scale engagements.<br />
Various research corporates swiftly introduced modification plans based on existing carriers. These designs integrate select technologies from Dreadnoughts and Supercarriers, significantly improving hull durability and repair efficiency.<br />
CONCORD has also unveiled the Yan-Jung’s neutrino complex-variable technology. Research corporations swiftly integrated this advancement, enabling the ship’s core neutrino radiation output to power Quantum Entanglement Generators, introducing new tactical dimensions to the battlefield.<br />
Ship Introduction<br />
Archon Navy Issue stands out among its class with exceptional armor strength and moderate repair capabilities, and also features an extended fighter range and superior weapon accuracy.<br />
Chimera Navy Issue boasts the strongest shield defenses among its class, excelling at countering fast-moving and small enemies.<br />
Thanatos Navy Issue excels among its class with unparalleled mobility, solid armor repair capabilities, high fighter damage, and effective defensive measures, making it a highly versatile choice.<br />
Nidhoggur Fleet Issue stands out with unmatched speed, rapid fighter speed, and high fighter damage, but its defenses remain weak.<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.<br />
How to obtain (Event): Purchase the limited Store Lucky Chest.</p>

<p><strong>Nanocores</strong><br />
Navy Issue and Basic Carriers can share Nanocores. Currently supported series include Neon Rain, Illusionary Ghost, Blue-and-White Porcelain, and Neon Gas. Future compatibility will gradually extend to all Nanocore series.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Pass</strong><br />
Navy Issue Carriers have been issued the High-Sec temporary pass, which will remain valid until the end of May.</p>

<p><strong>Quantum Entanglement Generator</strong><br />
A new mid-slot module that pairs with a target, triggering a quantum entanglement effect on success. Once linked, damage and repair effects between both ships partially synchronize or reverse. The entanglement activates instantly upon use but is influenced by distance. The closer the ships, the stronger the effect.<br />
This module requires specialized system support to function and can currently only be fitted on Navy Issue Carriers.<br />
Due to insufficient research, no related skills are currently available for training.</p>

<p>Nullify Quantum Entanglement Generator<br />
Both paired ships experience warp interference and deceleration simultaneously. Hull damage is partially synchronized, where when one vessel takes damage, the other suffers a percentage of that damage. This quantum-level effect directly impacts internal systems, bypassing all resistances.<br />
Destiny Quantum Entanglement Generator<br />
Both paired ships experience a slight boost in warp stability and flight speed simultaneously. Hull repair effects are partially synchronized, applying only to self-repair and remote repair modules, but ineffective for special methods like Focused Crystal and Shattered Star Nanocore.<br />
Reversal Quantum Entanglement Generator<br />
This generator's reversal effect causes both paired ships to simultaneously receive damage or repairs, but in opposite ways. When one ship takes damage, the other is repaired, and when one is repaired, the other suffers direct damage. Compared to other models, it has the lowest conversion efficiency and features a more complex technology.<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.<br />
How to obtain (Event): Available as a tiered reward in the Ship Lucky Chest.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Features</strong></span><br />
<strong>Verification Code Update Notice</strong><br />
To reduce the negative impact of bot accounts on the market economy and safeguard Capsuleers' interests, a captcha feature is planned for implementation. Capsuleers will need to verify themselves as human during prolonged, low-difficulty repetitive combat or mining activities.<br />
The verification server is currently undergoing configuration and testing, with an update scheduled soon.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Balance Updates</strong></span><br />
<strong>Sentry Fighters</strong><br />
The design concept of sentry fighters is inspired by large drones and sentry drones. Their firepower exceeds that of light offense fighters, boasting long-range capabilities with slightly reduced accuracy, which is ideal for engaging Capital Ships. With explosion radius modifications, they can also effectively target Battleships. Based on this, the following adjustments have been made:<br />
Sentry Fighter. Increase the damage by approximately 8.3%, increase the explosion velocity by approximately 9.5%, and reduce the explosion radius by approximately 22%.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Inquisitor Cosmic Anomaly</strong><br />
To alleviate combat and loot collection pressure on Capsuleers and minimize unnecessary ship swapping and repositioning time, adjustments have been made to the Advanced Inquisitor Cosmic Anomaly.<br />
The combat space has been standardized from 2/3 levels to 2 levels. The first level now keeps only the Acceleration Gate, while all loot and enemies have been relocated to the second level.<br />
A small number of pirate officers have been integrated into the pirate fleet, slightly increasing combat difficulty and rewards.<br />
Skill Neurons have been added to Loot Crates, and the chance of obtaining advanced rig blueprints has been increased.</p>

<p><strong>Market</strong><br />
The rate of Damaged Hull spawning upon the destruction of Astero and Garmur has been significantly reduced.<br />
The price of SoE Damaged Hull and Mordu's Legion Damaged Hull in the LP store is discounted by 20%.</p>

<p><strong>Cosmic Anomaly</strong><br />
The respawn interval for the Wasteseeker Siege Base has been reduced.<br />
The relative spawn rate of Blood Raiders and Sansha factions in other Faction Systems from the discovery of Capital Ship Hidden Rifts through Corporation Outpost scans has slightly reduced.</p>

<p><strong>Construction</strong><br />
The Morphite cost has been removed from the manufacturing materials of Augmented Fighters and Lightweight Ships, slightly lowering their total cost.<br />
The Logistic Drone blueprint's material requirement has been adjusted, increasing the ore ratio while reducing the planetary material ratio. Overall, the total cost has been slightly reduced.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Event</strong></span><br />
<strong>Recommended New Arrivals</strong><br />
Opening Time: April 23, 2025, 08:00 - May 14, 2025, 08:00 (UTC+0)<br />

<p><strong>Permanent Ship Store Closure Notice</strong><br />
The Permanent Ship Store will be closed after maintenance on April 30, 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Stellar Clash</strong><br />
Some Corps involved in irregular score manipulation have been penalized, and we will conduct an additional two-week review of the current Public Announcement data.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Optimizations</strong></span><br />
Close-in weapons will no longer fire when Capsuleers are offline, preventing accidental damage to fleet and alliance members.<br />
The initial deployment distance of drones and fighters now accounts for the ship's radius, preventing collisions with the mothership.<br />
Great Voyage Collaboration Drone Blueprint drops have been added to Wasteseeker Atlas and Checkpoint. Additionally, the closure time for the Great Voyage Collaboration Store has been extended by one week.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></span><br />
Fixed a rare issue where the interface displayed a repair amount exceeding 30% after activating Star Shatter mode (the actual repair amount remains 30% and updates correctly after taking damage or receiving repairs).<br />
Fixed a display issue with the default SKIN in the details interface for certain ships.<br />
Fixed issues related to sentry fighter attack range and market category.<br />
Fixed an issue where the Entosis Link could fail and cause the structure to become OOC.<br />
Fixed an issue where Corporation Tech bonuses could exceed theoretical values under certain circumstances<br />
Fixed an issue where rapidly opening and closing the Star Charts could potentially cause a crash<br />
Fixed an issue where the scanning interface could potentially crash</p>
