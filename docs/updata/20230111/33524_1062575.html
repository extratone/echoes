                Patch Notes - Jan 11

              </div>
              <div class="artCon">
                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">1/11/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0) </span></strong>and will take approximately <span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>120</strong></span> minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content</strong><br />
Dormant Realm</span><br />
The 5th level of the Dormant Realm, Surge Attack, is now available! It is recommended that your team include at least one Capsuleer who is skilled in mobile operations to stop the Sleepers from attacking New Eden.<br />
Get new implants in the new Dormant Realm level!<br />
Meanwhile, the following changes will be made to the reward rules for the Dormant Realm:<br />
1. The number of weekly rewards available has been adjusted from 3 per level to 6 for all levels. However, the number of reward chests players can earn for clearing each level will be changed to 2, which means the max number of reward chests available will remain unchanged.<br />
2. Capsuleers can use the "Copy and Claim" feature in the reward bar to duplicate the reward chest they want and get double rewards, but it will cost an additional attempt.<br />
3. Since the attempts to claim rewards are now shared among all levels, Capsuleers will have to manually discard their unwanted reward chests in the reward bar now, instead of letting high difficulty chests automatically replace low difficulty chests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Voyage Nanocore</span><br />
The new Directive Design Department Nanocore, Voyage, is now available in New Eden!<br />
The Voyage Nanocore offers a special "EM Eject" mode for Versatile Assault Ships, which allows Drones, Fighters, and Lightweight Ships nearby to achieve greater acceleration in a short time.<br />
Other ships will gain a "Micro Eject" mode upon fitting the Voyage Nanocore, allowing them to achieve greater acceleration in a short time and temporary immunity to Stasis Webifier.<br />
Participate in various events to earn Splendid Coupons, and this Nanocore will be yours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Implants</span></strong><br />
With the first batch of implants available for use, Capsuleers have created a slew of new tactics. Two more tactical implants will be available in this update: Tactical Missile and Mining Enhancement.<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Tactical Missile</span><br />
A missile implant used for tactical strikes against designated targets. It excels in damage output and warp disruption.<br />
When activated, it is able to boost missile damage and cause warp disruption to all enemies it attacks. However, it cannot switch targets and will automatically shut down when targets are destroyed.<br />
When the second skill is activated, it is able to further improve the rate of fire, flight velocity, explosion speed of missiles, and increase striking accuracy.<br />
The primary effects of the available branches include: reduced restart time, extended duration and removal of the automatic shutdown penalty, improved weapon disruption resistance, and improved warp disruption.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Mining Enhancement</span><br />
An industrial implant that enhances conventional mining and is capable of handling emergency situations.<br />
When activated, it is able to boost the mining capacity of Miners, Strip Miners, and Mining Drones. It can also increase the range of above modules, Salvagers, and Salvage Drones.<br />
When the second skill is activated, it can significantly strengthen the ship's core, thus improving the ship's warp stability, mobility, and hull resistance while reducing the activation time of all drones.<br />
The primary effects of the available branches include: Improved range, reduced activation time of Miners and other modules, larger cargo hold capacity, and activation of the Cargo Hold Self-Destruct Protection.<br />
Cargo Hold Self-Destruct Protection<br />
When this branch is selected and the Mining Enhancement is activated, a large-scale explosion will occur if a ship is destroyed. Its damage and range are affected by the ship's Max Hull Hitpoints and Signature Radius.<br />
How to obtain: Dormant Realm and New Eden Store</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Missile Implant Adjustments</span></strong><br />
Reduced damage penalties for Warhead Charge and Support Projection, allowing them to play a tactical role while providing damage output.<br />
Range-extending Warhead, damage penalty reduced to 10%<br />
Precision Warhead, damage penalty reduced to 15%<br />
Inflight Disruption Warhead and Inflight Retardant Warhead: damage penalty reduced to 20%<br />
EM/Thermal/Kinetic/Explosion Warhead: damage increased to 400%</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Home-returning Festival Packet</strong></span><br />
According to ancient legends, friends and family will send each other packets to bring hope and dispel bad luck. On the occasion of Home-returning Festival, we have launched the Home-returning Festival Packet for Corporations and Alliances, hoping to bring good wishes to New Eden.<br />
Capsuleers who use the Home-returning Festival Packet feature for the first time before Feb. 5, 2023 11:59:59 PM (UTC+0) will be rewarded with Splendid Coupon 1,000 points.<br />
A new "Packet" feature button has been added to the chat channel, and the Home-returning Festival Packet feature is available in the Corporation and Alliance chat channels. There are two types of Packets: Lucky Packets and Normal Packets.<br />
Capsuleers can send a Home-returning Festival Packet to the Corporation or Alliance chat channel by consuming ISK or AUR. Members of the Corporation or Alliance can click on the packet to claim the corresponding currency.<br />
See the in-game Home-returning Festival Packet feature for details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Arrivals</span></strong><br />
Duration: January 11, 2023 at 8:00:00 (UTC+0) to February 8, 2023 at 7:59:59 (UTC+0)<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Splendid Store</strong></span><br />
Duration: January 11, 2023 at 8:00:00 (UTC+0) to February 15, 2023 at 7:59:59 (UTC+0)<br />
The Splendid Store is now available. You can participate in various events or purchase Store Packs to get Splendid Coupons, which can be used to redeem items in the Splendid Store.<br />
All Splendid Coupons will be automatically converted to ISK at a 1:1 ratio once the Splendid Store is closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">NEW EVENT</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Carrier Design</span><br />
CONCORD publicly solicits the design drawings of carriers from Capsuleers. You will start from scratch, conduct research around the capabilities of the carriers, and make key decisions.<br />
While filling the progress bar of carrier design, one event will be triggered every time a milestone is reached. You need to make a choice during the event, which will permanently change the design of the carrier, thus affecting its positioning.<br />
You will unlock an award each time an event is completed. In addition, you will receive a Splendid Coupon (limited to once a week) for sharing your carrier design.<br />
Duration: 0:00, January 11, 2023 - 8:00, February 10, 2023</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Directive Design</span><br />
CONCORD will conduct a weekly summary during server maintenance. This means that the choices of the Capsuleers whose max limit of the week's progress has been reached for the events will have a direct impact on the "Directive Design" proposal.<br />
The choice that meets the above criteria and is made by the majority of Capsuleers in the same event will win. Each week after maintenance, the "Directive Design" proposal will be announced with a server-wide email reward.<br />
Event Duration: Jan. 11, 2023 to Feb. 15, 2023</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Eden Recruitment Event</span><br />
See the in-game New Eden Recruitment Event page for details.<br />
The New Eden Recruitment Event is back. Invite new and old Capsuleers to get lots of rewards.<br />
Invite your companions back to make New Eden a better, more exciting place!<br />
Tasks and rewards have been added to this event for invited Capsuleers. The invited Capsuleer can start reward tasks by linking with the inviter.<br />
Part of the Capsuleer and Returnee tasks have been modified and now ones have been added.<br />
Invitation Leaderboard has been added. The rules for ranking have been modified: The total number of invitation points earned by inviters in the Corporation will be counted and ranked on the basis of Corporation as a unit. There will be rewards for the Top 10 Corporations.<br />
Invitation store has reopened with new items, including implant materials.<br />
Duration: Jan. 13, 2023 0:00:00 to Mar. 7, 2023 0:00:00 (UTC+0)</span></p>

2. Fixed the issue where Bombard Tactics were invalid when piloting a Versatile Assault Ship.<br />
