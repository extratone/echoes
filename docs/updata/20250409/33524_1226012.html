                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#f39c12;">4/9/2025 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span> and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Features</strong></span><br />
Implant Quick Switch<br />
To improve the combat experience of Capsuleer, enhance long-range combat capabilities, and diversify combat strategies, we're now introducing the Implant Quick Switch feature, allowing Capsuleers to quickly switch Implants in space.<br />
How to Switch Implant:<br />
In space, simply tap to activate another Implant to switch. Switching costs 50 durability from the current Implant, and after switching, you must wait at least 3 minutes before switching again.<br />
Switching Conditions:<br />
*The currently fitted Implant is in a normal state, ready to be activated (not activated nor restarting)<br />
*The durability of the currently fitted Implant is greater than 60<br />
*Not in the switch cooldown<br />
*Not in abnormal states such as warping, jumping, or docking<br />
*Not in an attacking state (that is, no active weapons timer)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Balance Updates</span></strong><br />
Drone Manufacturing Blueprint<br />
With the unlocking of the Mining AI Core, New Eden's overall mining capacity has seen a significant boost.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">To reduce drone usage costs and stimulate ore demand, technicians have implemented updates and adjustments to the drone manufacturing blueprint.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">The core principles of the adjustments are as follows: a slight increase in ISK consumption, a moderate drop in planetary material usage, a significant increase in mineral consumption, and an overall slight drop in manufacturing costs.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">These adjustments apply to all 16 types of Combat Drones, with variations across different series. The general cost changes are outlined below:<br />
Mk.III. Manufacturing costs reduced by approximately 5%.<br />
Mk.5. Manufacturing cost reduced by approximately 7%.<br />
Mk.7. Manufacturing cost reduced by approximately 9%.<br />
Prototype. Manufacturing costs reduced by approximately 6%.<br />
Assault and Sniper. Manufacturing costs reduced by approximately 9%.<br />
Offense. Manufacturing costs reduced by approximately 7.5%.<br />
Integrated. Manufacturing costs reduced by approximately 3%.<br />
Augmented. Morphite cost removed, and manufacturing costs reduced by approximately 0.3%.<br />
Following the implementation of these adjustments, technicians will actively monitor market trends and usage rates of ore and drones. They will also continue refining fighters and lightweight ships to lower Capsuleer usage costs and stimulate market demand for items such as ore.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Capital Ship Blueprint Reverse Engineering</strong></span><br />
To reduce production steps, improve the production experience, expand skill coverage in manufacturing, reduce dependencies in ship production, and lower the usage costs of ships such as Force Auxiliaries, the following adjustments have been implemented to capital ship reverse engineering:<br />
Supercarrier Blueprints. Removed the 120 Force Auxiliary Damaged Hulls cost for reverse engineering, and increased the ISK cost from 2 billion to 3.5 billion. Overall, a slight drop in total cost.<br />
Dreadnought Blueprints. Reduced the Blueprint cost for reverse engineering from 64-66 to 64, increased the Datacore cost from 90 to 100, and increased the ISK cost from 850,000 to 10 million. Overall, a slight drop in total cost.<br />
Force Auxiliary Blueprints. Removed the 50 Carrier Damaged Hulls cost for reverse engineering, and increased the Force Auxiliary Damaged Hulls cost from 50 to 100. Overall, a slight drop in total cost.<br />
CyanSea Blueprint. Changed the Carrier Blueprint cost to a similar number of Datacores and Damaged Hulls costs, simplifying the process. After adjustment, the new cost is 240 for each of the 4 types of Damaged Hulls and 8 types of Datacores. Overall, a slight drop in total cost.<br />
Lucent-Moon Blueprint. Changed the Force Auxiliary Blueprint cost to Datacores and Damaged Hulls costs, simplifying the process. After adjustment, the new cost is 300 for each of the 4 types of Damaged Hulls and 8 types of Datacores. Overall, a slight drop in total cost.<br />
Freighter Blueprints. Increased the Level 10 Regular Damaged Hulls cost for reverse engineering from 85~86 to 240. Overall, a slight increase in total cost.<br />
Jump Freighter Blueprints. Removed the Carrier Damaged Hull and 10 Regular Ship Damaged Hull costs, and increased the reverse engineering cost from 8.5 million to 300 million. Overall, a slight drop in total cost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Advanced Dreadnought and Versatile Assault Ship Blueprints remain unchanged.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Ships</strong></span><br />
To ensure consistency in skill training across similar ships and enhance the experience for both new and veteran Capsuleers, the following adjustments have been implemented to the ships:<br />
Orca. Removed the Logistic Drone skill requirement. Changed the Logistic Drone repair bonus to be affected by Advanced Industrial Command Ships skill (reducing the skill requirement).<br />
Rorqual. Increased the Logistic Drone Shield Boost effect from +50% to +60%, increased the Remote Shield Booster effect from +7.5% to +10%, removed the Advanced Exhumer Drone Technology skill requirement, and changed the Exhumer Drone Mining amount bonus to be affected by Capital Industrial Ships skill (reducing the skill requirement).<br />
CyanSea. Removed the Remote Shield skill requirement, and changed the Pulse Wave bonus to be affected by Carrier skill (identical to other Carriers).<br />
Minokawa. Increased the Logistic Drone Shield Boost effect from +55% to +60%.<br />
Lif. Increased the Logistic Drone Shield Boost effect from +100% to +120%.<br />
Apostle. Increased the Logistic Drone Armor Repair effect from +55% to +60%.<br />
Ninazu. Increased the Logistic Drone Armor Repair effect from +100% to +120%.<br />
Lucent-Moon. Increased the Logistic Drone Shield Boost effect from +100% to +120%.<br />
The 4 Empire Force Auxiliary ships. Removed the Advanced Carrier Command skill requirement, and changed the Pulse Wave bonus to be affected by Advanced Force Auxiliary Command skill (identical to Lucent-Moon)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Modules</strong></span><br />
Small Remote Armor Repairer. Increased the Optimal Range from 7km to 7.5km.<br />
Medium Remote Armor Repairer. Increased the Range from 8.75km + 2.5km to 9km + 3km.<br />
Large Remote Armor Repairer. Increased the Accuracy Falloff from 3.5km to 4km.<br />
Capital Remote Armor Repairer. Increased the Range from 18km + 6km to 24km + 8km.<br />
Capital Remote Shield Booster. Increased the Range from 10 km + 15 km to 13.4 km + 20 km.<br />
'Longbow' Fire-control Reinforcement System. New effect: Scan Resolution +30% when activated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Event</strong></span><br />
EVE Echoes × Great Voyage Collab<br />
Opening Time: April 9, 2025, 08:00 - April 30, 2025, 00:00 (UTC+0)<br />
EVE Echoes × Great Voyage Collab Event is now live. Let's embark on an unprecedented adventure in the boundless starry sea!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Great Voyage Collab Store<br />
Opening Time: April 9, 2025, 08:00 - April 30, 2025, 00:00 (UTC+0)<br />
New items available include the Great Voyage Sniper Module Opt Supply, the Great Voyage Integrated Module Draw Supply, and the Great Voyage Module Blueprint Draw Supply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Great Voyage Collab Drones/Fighters<br />
Leveraging data from the "Age of Discovery" aircraft, Minmatar was the first to pioneer the development of the latest Sentry Drone and Sentry Fighter.<br />
How to obtain: Store purchase, industry manufacture.<br />
During the event, there is a chance to obtain blueprints by purchasing Equipment Transport Crates from the Collab Store. They also have a chance to drop from Cosmic Anomalies such as Wasteseeker Checkpoints and Wasteseeker Maps later.<br />
This collaboration includes two types of sentry drones/fighters, each with 3 variants for Capsuleers to choose from:<br />
Sentry Drone - Compass Sentinel<br />
This drone is a modification of the "Tebrus," an aircraft designed by Da Vinci in "Great Voyage." By sacrificing propulsion power, it achieves an extended range and deals kinetic and explosive damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Sentry Fighter - Sextant Sentinel<br />
This fighter is a modification of the "Dimichet," an aircraft designed by Da Vinci in "Great Voyage." By sacrificing propulsion power, it achieves an extended range and delivers kinetic and explosive damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Great Voyage Collab Event Encounters<br />
Opening Time: April 9, 2025, 08:00 - May 1, 2025, 00:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Added new Encounter Missions of advanced difficulty and above. During the event, Capsuleers can accept collab Encounter Missions from the Encounters panel and defeat the sleeper.<br />
Accept and complete the Expert difficulty encounter "Ghost Projection" to obtain the Collab Mission Assignment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Set Sail: Event Manual<br />
Opening Time: April 9, 2025, 08:00 - April 30, 2025, 00:00 (UTC+0)<br />
Set Sail: The Event Manual is now available!<br />
Complete designated missions to get awesome rewards. Unlocking the manual will also grant extra rewards such as the Great Voyage Sniper Module Opt Supply, the Great Voyage Integrated Module Draw Supply, and the Cosmic Treasure Opt Supply.<br />
Moving forward, we will create more valuable and thematic rewards for the Event Manual. The Cosmic Treasure Opt Box will only be available as a limited-time, ultra-low discount item during holidays.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Permanent Ship Store and Store Lineup Adjustments</strong></span><br />
While the permanent ship supply has offered Capsuleers additional ways to acquire ships, it has also encroached on the market for Capsuleers specializing in Construction and Manufacturing. As a result, the store will be permanently closed after maintenance on April 30, 2025, and will no longer remain open indefinitely. Going forward, the Ship Supply Cache will only be available for a limited time during select events.<br />
The Star of Trailblazers - Carrier Encrypted Transport Container and Decoder have caused an excessive disruption to the ship and blueprint market. As a result, they will be permanently removed from sale on April 30, 2025, and will not return. CyanSea ships will be distributed through alternative methods during select events for a limited time.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Optimizations</strong></span><br />
When the Mining AI Core is active, the Orbiting function will no longer be forcibly enabled. Instead, it will utilize AI combat auto-orbit settings. Please note that this may result in them exceeding the mining range. Capsuleers are advised to familiarize themselves with belt distribution and their ship's mining range to determine whether orbiting should be enabled.<br />
Increase the speed of searching for Asteroid Belts and Ore when the mining AI Core is operating.<br />
Various module icons have been updated to enhance their recognition, including the following modules: Heat Sink, Gyrostabilizer, Magnetic Field Stabilizer, Macro Particle Stabilizer, Missile Guidance Computer, Fighter Microwarpdrive Guide, and Advanced Resource Extraction Management Center.<br />
Updated icons for 16 types of combat drones, including Standard, Assault/Sniper, Offense, and Integrated/Augmented models. Further optimization and updates to Fighter and Lightweight Ship icons will be implemented based on Capsuleer feedback.<br />
In the Pilot Contacts interface, you can now search for Corporations and Alliances.<br />
The number of Tesseract Star Cores required for the Rorqual AI Core has been reduced from 1600 to 800. Capsuleers who have already upgraded will receive compensation.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></span><br />
Fixed the issue where the DPS display was inaccurate in certain situations when the sequence of using Implants or Tactical Modules differed.<br />
Fixed the issue where the cloaking effect of ships, such as the Rorqual, was not fully applied.<br />
Fixed the issue with the Nanocore projection icon display for the Allegiance.</span></p>
