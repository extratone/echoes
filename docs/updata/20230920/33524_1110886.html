EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong>9/20/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</strong> and will take approximately <strong>120 minutes to</strong> complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content</strong><br />
Structure: Asteroid Detection Array</span><br />
A quantum radar used for monitoring in-system asteroid anomalies, which can increase the level of the Asteroid Belts detected.<br />
It can be anchored to a System with sovereignty, and its effect will be applied to any newly discovered Asteroid Belts.<br />
The effect can be further improved by upgrading the Corporation Tech.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the Jita market</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Asteroid Detection Array Enhancement Tech</span><br />
It enhances all asteroid detection arrays owned by the Corporation and improves their effectiveness in detecting asteroid belts.<br />
Unlock at Corporation Level 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Implant: Artillery Cover</span><br />
Suitable for all types of cannons, this implant passively increases the cannon's ammo charge and firing power, increases the firing interval, and deals a higher percentage of damage.<br />
Fire Coverage (Lv. 1) : Increases cannon tracking speed when activated. Better for small, fast targets, but reduces the effect of the passives.<br />
Artillery Support (Lv. 15) : Increases accuracy falloff. Good for medium to long-range combat.<br />
Ballistic Prediction (Lv. 15) : Increases tracking speed. When firing, part of the accuracy falloff range will be calibrated to the optimal range. Good for medium and close-range combat.<br />
Armor Melter (Lv. 30) : Increases thermal damage and deals more thermal damage to targets with low thermal shield resistance. Good against ordinary enemies.<br />
Blast Charge (Lv. 30) : Increases explosive damage and penetrates a small amount of explosion resistance but deals reduced kinetic damage. Good against elite enemies.<br />
Full Salvo (Lv. 45) : Launches a saturation strike on the enemy shortly after activation. Deals light damage to targets in range even if it misses, but has no effect if it hits the enemy successfully.<br />
(The damage depends on weapon size, range, distance to the target, flight velocity, signature radius, and other parameters. Good for suppressing small and medium high-speed targets)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Implant: Aerospace Tactics</span><br />
Suitable for drones, fighters, and lightweight ships, this implant passively improves the drones' high-speed combat capability, increases their damage and flight velocity, and reduces their inertia modifier.<br />
Aerial Combat Determination (Lv. 1): When activated, increases the effective range of drone commands (excluding fighters), significantly reduces the flight velocity of drones and fighters, and increases their range. Suitable for damage avoidance or enhancing firepower, and also for sentry drones.<br />
Close Combat Technique (Lv. 15) : Enhances close combat capabilities, increasing drone’s turret tracking speed and rocket and missile explosion velocity and reducing their signature radius.<br />
Mighty Arsenal (Lv. 15) : Increases drone damage and defense but reduces flight velocity.<br />
Recovery Technique (Lv. 30) : Increases the recovery range and flight velocity of drones.<br />
Efficient Commanding (Lv. 30) : Increases the range of drone and fighter commands, which also applies to lightweight ships at a reduced effect.<br />
Tactical Determination (Lv. 45) : When any drone is under attack, trigger the designated tactic when its shield drops too low. Can be toggled between Adaptive Determination and Desperate Determination.<br />
Adaptive Determination: All drones route their power to power and engine, reducing shield recharge time and increasing stasis webifier resistance and flight velocity.<br />
Desperate Determination: All drones route their power to shield and weapon, increasing damage and shield resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Skill: Structure Weapon System</span><br />
Skills pertaining to the management and operation of structure weapon systems. Increases the damage and performance of structure weapons.<br />
How to obtain: Purchase and train with ISK</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Supercarrier AI Core Now Available</span><br />
Four Supercarrier AI Cores are now available, including: Nyx, Wyvern, Hel, and Aeon<br />
The powerful performance of a supercarrier means it requires greater maneuverability. Upgrading the AI core requires twice as much material as upgrading a small carrier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Corporation Tech: Personnel Expansion</span><br />
Increases the Max Corp. Members.<br />

PPD Fullerene Fibers’s Pyerite quantity cost adjusted to 500</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Capital Cosmic Anomaly</span><br />
With the addition of supercarriers to the main fleets of major factions, the passion for carrier research has also declined. Pirate factions have reduced their stockpile of advanced capital ship components. They now primarily maintain capital ship testing grounds to conduct specialized research on a smaller scale but at a higher frequency.<br />
Capital Ship Rally Point, Capital Ship Special Fleet, and Capital Ship Quarry<br />
Spawn rate increased by 15%<br />
No longer drops Advanced Capital Ship Component Shipping Container</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Capital Rift and Capital Ship Testing Ground</span><br />
Capital Rift and Capital Ship Testing Ground are currently the most difficult battles due to their long combat time, long flight distance, and high difficulty. These factors are not conducive to capsuleers’ participation. Therefore, we have made the following optimizations to them:<br />
*&nbsp; Removed the ores in the large route at level 1. Increased the compressed ore capacity at level 2 by 20%<br />
* Reduced the distance to the route entrance from about 120km to 90km, and the area of level 2 has been adjusted to have the same size as level 1<br />
* Reduced the number of side routes from 4 to 3<br />
* Removed the most difficult last wave of enemies in each space (the spawn pattern of supercarrier has not been changed)<br />
* For Capital Rift, added 2/3 capital ships to the first two waves, which have relatively low difficulty, respectively<br />
For Capital Rift, the fuel usage for scans has been reduced to 720,000, and the number of scans per week has been increased from 2 to 3.<br />
* Increased the spawn rate of Capital Ship Testing Ground by 15%</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Wasteseeker Cosmic Anomaly</span><br />
Wasteseeker Checkpoint has been changed, where it will only be destroyed after all of the loot crates have been looted<br />
Removed the common modules and rig blueprints from Wasteseeker Checkpoint, and increased the drop rates of rare blueprints<br />
Removed rig blueprints from Relic Sites, and added implant blueprints (Aerospace Tactics &amp; Artillery Cover)<br />
Increased the drop rates of perfect salvaged parts and skill chip blueprints at Data Sites</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Mining</span><br />
Reduced the number of gas clouds C50 and C60 in common asteroid belts<br />
Changed the natural despawn time of common asteroid belts to 1 day<br />
Wasteseeker drones in Asteroid Cluster of Cobalt Edge have a tiny chance of carrying Advanced Strip Miner (Metalevel 5/8)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Encounters</span><br />
In normal encounter missions, enemy ship wrecks typically drop low-value modules that held some value in the early days of New Eden. Nowadays, these modules are outdated in performance, and capsuleers are more inclined to discard them due to their low recycling value. Therefore, we’ve planned to make the following adjustments:<br />
In expert and higher difficulty encounters:<br />
Removed the low-value modules dropped in encounter missions<br />
Upon defeating NPC pirates, they have a small chance to drop the abandoned properties of pirates, which can be used to redeem LP at a station</span></p>
