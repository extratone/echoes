Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp; EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong>8/16/2023 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</strong> and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Cobalt Edge&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Region Briefing&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
As the exploration of New Eden's border regions progresses, an increasing number of people are directing their attention to Cobalt Edge. Capsuleers refer to it as the Far Sub-galaxy because it is one of the eight far regions awaiting exploration.<br />
After long hard work, CONCORD and the trailblazers completed the initial exploration of Cobalt Edge and established the first logistics supply depot. Information on Cobalt Edge will now be made available to all capsuleers.<br />
Cobalt Edge is composed of 10 Constellations, with a total of 69 systems, all of which have a security level below 0.<br />
Cobalt Edge has a large number of hostile “Wasteseeker Drone” ships, as well as a large number of ancient relics.<br />
Unstable wormholes appear randomly in Cobalt Edge, which is connected with other regions in New Eden.<br />
Capsuleers can navigate ships through unstable wormholes to explore such unknown regions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Unstable Wormhole&nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Wormholes are random passages that connect two places in the universe. Wormholes may lead to a known system or a completely unknown wormhole system, regardless of their physical location.<br />
Thanks to the popularity of warp drives, capsuleers can steer their ships through wormholes to jump, much like a stargate.<br />
The recently discovered wormholes are distributed in Cobalt Edge and the low-sec space of New Eden, with multiple wormholes leading to the same rift space. Capsuleers can quickly move between multiple regions through wormholes.<br />
The rift space is a type of micro-space, instead of a complete “wormhole system”. Wasteseeker Drones are common in this space, so capsuleers need to be prepared for battle.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Wormhole System</span><br />
A special and completely unknown system that can only be reached through a certain kind of wormhole. The New Eden star charts have no record of it, and there is no presence of CONCORD or the empires in the system.<br />
The unstable wormholes found so far are a passage that only randomly appears in ordinary systems within the empires and Cobalt Edge. It is not possible to reach the wormhole system through these wormholes.<br />
As technology advances, it may become possible to discover special wormholes leading to the wormhole system in the future.<br />
<br />
Finding a Wormhole<br />
Unstable wormhole signals are unique and can be easily detected by any scanner. After opening the star map, capsuleers can see the wormhole in their current region directly.<br />
<br />
Ship Restrictions<br />
All ships, including supercapital, can pass through the unstable wormholes. However, the wormhole will collapse and disappear after a while, hence, the name “unstable wormhole”.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Jump Fatigue</span><br />
As with the jump drive, after traversing the wormhole, capsuleers will enter a state of fatigue for 60 seconds, during which no noticeable effects will be felt.<br />
If you pass through the wormhole again while fatigued, capsuleers will be weakened for 180 seconds. Capsuleers will not be able to pass through the wormhole while weakened. Therefore, capsuleers need to plan carefully for their wormhole traversing timing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Stargate&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Due to the constraints of the environment and the Wasteseeker, the trailblazers have so far only succeeded in building the stargates inside the Constellation. No stargates were built across Constellations and across regions.<br />
Capsuleers can enter a Constellation in Cobalt Edge through an unstable wormhole, but cannot enter Cobalt Edge through a stargate from another Cobalt Edge region. Capsuleers are also unable to move through between multiple Constellations in Cobalt Edge through stargates.<br />
Thankfully, jump navigation was less affected. If there are cynosural beacons in another Constellation, capsuleers can initiate a jump with their jump drive but cannot perform the jump across regions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">System Broadcast&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Due to the constraints of the environment and the Wasteseeker, no broadcast management centers have been established yet in any of the systems in Cobalt Edge, so there is no way to view online capsuleers yet. The number of local capsuleers will be displayed as ?.<br />
Capsuleers may choose to broadcast their own local messages so that other capsuleers in the current system can receive them, but doing so will reveal their own presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Station&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Due to the constraints of the environment and the Wasteseeker, the trailblazers have only successfully built a small logistics supply station located at E-BYOS System - Planet VI, which has been made open to all capsuleers.<br />
The station offers maintenance, construction, a hangar, and other features and functions. However, it does not feature sentry guns, and supercapital ships are unable to dock here. Please be mindful of such limitations.<br />
Due to the constraints of the environment, capsuleers are unable to set this station as their base. However, thanks to the strengthened Cloning Center, Jump Clone is still operable.<br />
Please note that capsuleers may only enter Cobalt Edge by Jump Clone up to 3 times a day. Otherwise, the nerve system of the capsuleer will be overwhelmed. Even the nerve relief service cannot relieve such a state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Outpost&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Due to constraints of the environment, none of the currently available capsuleer outpost, corporation outpost, and add-on structures can be anchored in Cobalt Edge.<br />
Our scientists have attempted to improve the structure of the ordinary outpost by introducing a variety of materials and have successfully developed the Recon Outpost, which can be anchored in the special environment of Cobalt Edge.<br />
Please note that Recon Outpost can only undergo one hull reinforcement and cannot perform shield hardening due to its different structure.<br />
Capsuleers may purchase its blueprint from the market and then manufacture it. Due to its weak resource production capacity, it is recommended to give priority to anchoring ordinary outposts in normal circumstances.<br />
Capsuleer Scout Outpost<br />
A capsuleer outpost suitable for reconnaissance and skirmishes equipped with more weapon slots.<br />
This outpost forgoes low slot power output ports for increased strength and stability and comes with repair and basic construction production lines.<br />
Corporation Reconnaissance Outpost<br />
A reconnaissance outpost suitable for use as a corporation forward base. It’s easy to deploy and has a strong defense capability.<br />
Like other scouting outposts, this outpost similarly forgoes power anchor output ports for increased strength and stability and comes with repair and basic construction production lines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Asteroid Belt&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In the asteroid belt of Cobalt Edge, apart from the common assortment of ores and gas clouds found in New Eden, a gas cloud known as C70 has been discovered. This particular cloud is utilized in the research and development of new materials.<br />
Recent reports have revealed the presence of hidden Wasteseeker drones within the asteroid belt, which may attack ships during their mining operations. Capsuleers are advised to maintain a high level of vigilance when mining.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Planetary Interaction&nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Reports indicated that no new resources have been identified in Cobalt Edge, and its common resources do not significantly differ from those found in other systems within New Eden.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Wasteseeker&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
"Wasteseeker" appear in the far borders of New Eden and is the collective term for the drone faction. These drones, ranging in size from frigates and battleships to even supercarriers, constantly patrol, scavenge, and salvage ship wrecks in space to build their own “bodies.” They operate in groups, competing with Capsuleers for limited resources and living space.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Wasteseeker Encampment&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
A Wasteseeker encampment commonly found in Cobalt Edge. They vary in size and are filled with Wasteseeker drones engaged in wreck salvaging operations.<br />
After defeating the Wasteseeker Drone, capsuleers have a chance to obtain various materials used in manufacturing ships and modules. The type and amount of materials obtained depend on the drone's capability to reprocess the wreck.<br />
CONCORD has offered a bounty for capsuleers to help CONCORD in conducting more research on Wasteseeker drones, but no specific missions have been published yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Wasteseeker Checkpoint&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
A rare large encampment in Cobalt Edge. Alongside the presence of ordinary drones, this encampment is also inhabited by elite entities that bear a striking resemblance to “officers”. Hence, the encampment is named the “Wasteseeker Checkpoint”.<br />
Defeat the elite drones among them to get materials that are commonly used to manufacture advanced ships and modules in New Eden.<br />
Once all enemies have been defeated, some unanalyzed relics will become accessible, allowing capsuleers to obtain blueprints, materials, and other valuable loot from there.<br />
Some claimed to have seen a “Wasteseeker Drone Hive”, but all reported sightings have abruptly ceased in recent times. The reason behind this sudden halt remains unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Ancient Relics</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
A rare ancient relic found in Cobalt Edge. It appears to have served as a multifunctional facility for production and research purposes, which hold significant research value. Wasteseeker Drones are also a common sighting here.<br />
You need to use a scanner to find these relics, and they are much more difficult to analyze. Please be ready before approaching, capsuleers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Wasteseeker Drone&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
The currently confirmed conventional ships of the Wasteseeker Drones consist of a total of 8 types as follows:<br />
Ghost Wind, Tracker, Savanna, Rusting, Ruins, Boulder Shatterer, Rover, and Scorched Land.<br />
Unfortunately, due to a lack of appropriate knowledge and technology, it is currently impossible to retrieve the damaged hull of the Wasteseeker Drone from its wreck. Similarly, researchers are at a loss as to how far they can reverse engineer these ships.<br />
Judging by the weaponry utilized by the Wasteseekers, their armament resembles a medium-range hybrid weapon of a cannon and a decomposer. As our technology advances, the potential for mastering Wasteseeker weapons and battleship technologies remains within reach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>New Content&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Ship&nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
As the conflicts in distant regions escalate, researchers have introduced a new class of Navy Issue Frigates with enhanced combat versatility. These include:<br />
Punisher Navy Issue, Kestrel Navy Issue, Rifter Fleet Issue, Incursus Navy Issue, and Tristan Navy Issue<br />
Similar to Navy Issue battleships, these ships inherit the characteristics of Navy Issue ships, including high firepower, low rate of fire, fast locking, strong sensor strength, and minimal resistance weaknesses. Additionally, they possess the strong maneuverability of frigates, allowing them to excel on certain battlefields.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering<br />
Obtain through the event: Obtained from the Star of Trailblazers event manual</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Corporation Tech</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
With the introduction of Corporation Reconnaissance Outposts, the demand for an increased anchor number of Corporation Outposts has become crucial. In response to this need, CONCORD has made available the corporation tech on territory expansion.<br />
The first batch of tech made available includes Territorial Expansion I (Level 2 Corporation) and Territorial Expansion II (Level 4 Corporation). Each of the techs can be upgraded by 2 levels, resulting in a total increase of 4 Corporation Outposts that can be anchored.<br />
Please note that only one Corporation Reconnaissance Outpost can be anchored, and it shares the maximum anchoring limit with Corporation Outposts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Drone&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
After engaging in battles with the Wasteseeker Drones, researchers have successfully developed an integrated technology tailored specifically for drones and have introduced a comprehensive range of integrated types for all drone models.<br />
The design of these integrated models incorporates multiple components sourced from the Wasteseeker Drones, which enhances their performance in various aspects.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained from Wasteseeker Checkpoints and Ancient Relics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Fighter&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
With technological advancements, the Light Space Superiority Fighter “Shrike” and the Light Offense Fighter "Red-tailed Hawk" have been unveiled.<br />
This ship is one of the significant accomplishments of archaeological research. Its weapons incorporate decomposer technology, providing it with impressive firepower, optimal range, and shooting stability. The ship utilizes partial stealth technology to reduce its signature radius, thereby enhancing its survivability on the battlefield.<br />
These two fighter models are available in Basic, Assault, Offense, and Integrated types, and their weapons deal hybrid damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Implant Unit&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
As the battles with the Wasteseeker Drones intensify, researchers have introduced a wider range of implant units specifically designed for drones, fighters, and lightweight ships.<br />
General Fire-control System’s Precision Upgrade: Increases precision but lowers damage.<br />
General Fire-control System’s Damage Boost: Increases damage but lowers precision.<br />
Mothership Defense Module’s Defense Upgrade: Increases defense but lowers offense.<br />
Mothership Defense Module’s Damage Boost: Increases offense but lowers defense.<br />
Drone Navigation Computer’s Endurance Optimization, Fighter Microwarpdrive Guides’ Endurance Optimization, and Mothership Defense Module’s Endurance Optimization: Allows intensive optimization on the module for extended endurance, greatly reducing its restart time, but also greatly lowers its boosting effect.<br />
When utilizing the advanced unit and after mastering the corresponding skills, the module will remain active if its restart time drops to zero.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them from Ancient Relics</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Rigs&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
As the battles with the Wasteseeker Drones intensify, the importance of remote logistics capabilities is increasingly acknowledged. Thus, the rigs for the Remote Shield Booster and the Remote Armor Repairer have been introduced to address this need.<br />
These rigs can increase the repair efficiency and speed, reduce the cost, and increase the range.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained from Wasteseeker Checkpoints and Ancient Relics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Module</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
During operations, many combat personnel grew increasingly aware of the inadequate defensive capabilities of their warships. The introduction of shield generators and titanium armor has played a role in alleviating these shortcomings.<br />
Compared to traditional shield extenders, this shield generator can suppress the ship's signature radius and increase the shield's maximum strength and recharge rate, but its magnetic field sharpening effect is somewhat reduced, limiting its effectiveness in emergency hardening.<br />
Compared to steel plates, titanium armor can better embody the characteristics of titanium. It possesses good ductility, high strength, lightweight, and low electrical and thermal conductivity. However, its strength drops at high temperatures. Furthermore, the magnetic field sharpening effect is not as effective as steel plates, which is not conducive to emergency hardening and maintenance.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained from Wasteseeker Checkpoints and Ancient Relics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Materials&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
As mass mining of C70 now becomes possible, researchers have also made available the production blueprints of the new material.<br />
Among the first materials to be introduced are Fullero-Ferrocene and Fullerene Intercalated Graphite, which can be used in the manufacture of new structures and ships.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market<br />
In addition to the above new materials, the refining and reprocessing capabilities of the Wasteseeker Drones have significantly increased the yield of precious metals and non-CS crystals. These materials are extensively used in the manufacturing of the new drones and modules.<br />
How to obtain: Obtained by defeating Wasteseeker Drone.</span></p>
