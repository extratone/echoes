<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Content</strong></span><br />
Tactical Carrier<br />
With the deployment of Assault Carriers and Supercarriers in combat and the acquisition of extensive research data, the four major empires have introduced a new generation of Supercarriers equipped with Lightweight Ships, naming them Tactical Carriers.<br />
Benefiting from the research achievements of the first-generation Supercarriers, Tactical Carriers also boast impressive electronic warfare resistance and defensive capabilities. Additionally, they can be equipped with various tactical modules, including:<br />
Capital Cynosural Field Generators, Carrier Defense Modules, Jump Overload Burst, and Capital Jump Field Generators, among others.<br />
(Note: Cannot be fitted with modules such as Supercarrier Cover Modules, Burst Projectors, or Command Bursts.)<br />
Ship Characteristics<br />
Rahab: Specialize in deploying Lightweight Ships armed with missiles and rockets. It features high weapon accuracy, fair yet reliable firepower, and excellent shield resistance and max shield capacity.<br />
Midgard: Offer decent firepower with average weapon accuracy. Both the Lightweight Ships and the Carrier itself have high speed. While shield strength is low, it is easier to repair.<br />
Superbia: The Lightweight Ships it deploys have extended turret range and good accuracy. Both the Carrier and its Lightweight Ships exhibit excellent defensive performance.<br />
Hades: Boast a well-balanced combination of firepower, range, defense, and mobility, making it a powerhouse comprehensively.</p>

<p>Tactical Carrier Manufacture<br />
As Tactical Carriers are still in the experimental phase and possess extremely powerful combat capabilities, they are currently under strict regulation by the empires. They can only be reverse-engineered and manufactured in Trading Centers located in designated systems heavily guarded by imperial forces. Capsuleers must transport materials from across the universe to the designated stations. Manufacturing Tactical Carriers requires Capital Ship Components, Advanced Capital Ship Components, and intermediate materials.<br />
Designated Systems:<br />
Rahab can be manufactured in Tama.<br />
Midgard can be manufactured in Istodard.<br />
Superbia can be manufactured in Asghed.<br />
Hades can be manufactured in Ostingele.</p>

<p>In addition to being restricted to manufacturing within the star systems designated by the empires, CONCORD and the four empires have agreed that each Corporation is currently limited in the number of Tactical Carriers it can produce. Manufacturing authorization can be obtained by unlocking Corporation Tech.<br />
The Corporation Tech are as follows:<br />
Tactical Carrier Manufacturing Authorization I: Requires Corporation Lv.5. Unlocks the ability to manufacture a Carrier (cannot exceed max manufacturable cap using Manufacturing Increment Decoders).<br />
Tactical Carrier Manufacturing Authorization II: Requires Corporation Lv.6. Raise the max manufacture cap by 1-3, and increase the number of ship that can be manufactured at the same time by 1.<br />
Tactical Carrier Manufacturing Authorization III: Requires Corporation Lv.7. Raise the max manufacture cap by another 1-6, and increase the number of ship that can be manufactured at the same time by 1.<br />
Currently, each Corporation can conduct up to 10 Reverse Engineering attempts on blueprints and manufacture up to 10 Tactical Carriers after unlocking all Tech. A Corporation can simultaneously reverse-engineer up to 3 blueprints and manufacture up to 3 ships at a time.<br />
Note: Tactical Carrier research requires massive investment. Failed Reverse Engineering attempts count toward the total limit, so please do try to maximize the success rate. Ships can be insured, so trading or ship destruction does not count toward the manufacture cap.</p>

<p>Micro Jump Drive<br />
A micro jump drive for intra-system combat. Activation requires a warm-up period, after which it instantly propels the ship forward a fixed distance. Upon arrival, the ship maintains its direction and velocity.<br />
Note: This module does not allow orientation adjustment once activated and can be disabled by Warp Scramblers, Interdiction Spheres, or Warp Disruption Field Generators.<br />
Only ships supporting this technology can be fitted with it and use it. Initial compatible ships include 4 Bomber Battleships.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained in the new Inspector Cosmic Anomalies.</p>

<p>Micro Jump Drive Field Generator<br />
A micro jump field generator for intra-system combat. Activation requires a warm-up period, and while warming up, orientation cannot be changed. Once activated, it instantly teleports up to 20 conventional ships and their drones within range to a location 100km ahead. Upon arrival, the ship maintains its direction and velocity.<br />
This micro jump drive field only affects ships piloted by Capsuleers. The closer a vessel is to the field’s center, the higher the likelihood of being affected.<br />
Only ships supporting this technology can be fitted with it and use it. Initial compatible ships include 4 Advanced Tactical Destroyers.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained in the new Inspector Cosmic Anomalies.</p>

<p>Capital Micro Jump Drive Field Generator<br />
The capital variant of the standard Micro Jump Drive Field Generator. This micro jump drive field only affects ships piloted by Capsuleers, with capital ships being the primary targets. The closer a vessel is to the field’s center, the higher the likelihood of being affected. Only Tactical Carriers can be fitted with this module and use it.<br />
How to obtain: Obtain the blueprint through Capital Ship Proving Grounds and manufacture it (the blueprint has a high rarity rating)</p>

<p>Jump Overload Burst<br />
A mid-slot tactical module that projects a nano-enhancement field onto fleet allies, temporarily boosting their jump drive capabilities and providing long-range jump navigation support. Only Tactical Carriers equipped with this technology can be fitted with it and use it.<br />
Primary Effect: Improve warp stability, reduce capacitor consumption for jumps, increase jump range, enhance Sun Chaser navigation range, enable Sun Chaser navigation to activate in null sec systems where security levels meet the conditions, and training skills can further improve these effects.<br />
How to obtain: Obtain the blueprint through Capital Ship Proving Grounds and manufacture it</p>

<p>Structure Siege Array<br />
A specialized structure defense system. Using remote energy transmission technology, it transfers the immense energy of the structure to the target ship, enhancing its engine, power, and damage control systems, thereby significantly boosting its combat capabilities. If the target is a capital ship, it can also offset excessive damage received.<br />
This complex facility can only be fitted in the dedicated slots of the Fortizar. The system's underlying code complies with CONCORD's anti-monopoly agreement and can only be used by Alliances and Corporations with fewer sovereignties.<br />
This module is the first defensive specialized structure module to comply with this agreement, and more specialized structure modules adhering to this agreement will be introduced in the future.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.</p>

<p>Lightweight Cruiser/Battlecruiser<br />
With Tactical Carriers entering the battlefield, the demand for lightweight ships has further increased, leading to the emergence of lightweight cruisers and battlecruisers.<br />
To adapt to drone combat, the warp drive and damage repair systems were removed, and components such as the cargo hold, armor, and structure were significantly simplified. The improved engine, radar, and weapon systems make it highly suitable for close-range combat.<br />
Since this technology is being publicly introduced for the first time, only the basic model is currently available for Capsuleers. The specific models are as follows:<br />
Lightweight Cruiser<br />
Disruption: Blackbird, Bellicose, Arbitrator, Celestis<br />
Balanced: Caracal, Stabber, Omen, Thorax</p>

<p>Lightweight Battlecruiser<br />
Balanced: Drake, Hurricane, Harbinger, Brutix<br />
Offense: Naga (Modified Missile Type), Tornado, Oracle, Talos<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.<br />
(Note: To better align ISK and industrial material supply and demand with the current state of New Eden, the blueprints for basic lightweight ships will gradually be adjusted to be sold on the market.)</p>

<p>Tactical Carrier Hangar Modification<br />
Based on improvements to lightweight ship hangar modifications, it allows adjustments to the structural distribution of Tactical Carriers, enabling changes to the number of mid-slots, lightweight cruiser launchers, and lightweight battlecruiser launchers.<br />
How to obtain: Obtain the blueprints for specific models through reverse engineering first, and the hangars for designated lightweight ships can then be subsequently modified to suit the Tactical Carrier models</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Balance Adjustments</strong></span><br />
Ship Adjustments<br />
The four Advanced Tactical Destroyers, including Endurer. New bonus: Can be fitted with the Micro Jump Drive Field Generator.<br />
The four Bomber Battleships. New bonus: Can be fitted with the Micro Jump Drive Field Generator.<br />
The four Supercarriers. Structure Hitpoints increased by approximately 20%.<br />
After the maintenance, the Bodyguard Dreadnoughts will no longer be able to operate in high-sec areas.</p>

<p>Important Adjustments to Versatile Assault Ships<br />
To make it easier for Capsuleers to explore different ships, improve design consistency, and reduce the burden on novice Capsuleers, a series of skill and ship system simplifications and integrations will be introduced. This phase of updates includes the following changes:<br />
Versatile Assault Ships have been renamed to Assault Carriers and officially integrated into the carrier system. The vessel itself benefits from carrier skill bonuses, while the weapon systems remain unchanged.<br />
Nanocore attribute bonuses effective for Carriers are now also applicable to Assault Carriers.<br />
Removed the Versatile Assault Ship Operation, Versatile Assault Ship Defense Upgrade, and Versatile Assault Ship Engineering skill groups. Capsuleers who have learned these skills can reset them to gain Free Skill Points. This does not cost any Lazarus Units.<br />
Increased the purchase price of the Carrier Operation, Carrier Defense Upgrade, and Carrier Engineering skill groups to match the price of the merged Versatile Assault Ship skill groups.<br />
Details of Skill Bonus Adjustments:<br />
Carrier Operation. Due to the lower inertia modifier bonus of Carrier skills compared to Versatile Assault Ship skills, the base inertia modifier of the four Assault Carriers has been reduced (approximately to 79%) to maintain mobility.<br />
Carrier Defense Upgrade skill: Defense Bonus increased from +25000 to +50000.<br />
To enhance the fitting versatility of Assault Carriers, their powergrid has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Carrier Engineering. The bonuses remain the same as before, with no adjustments made.</p>

<p>Module Adjustment<br />
The repair effect of the Quantum Entanglement Device has been adjusted from converting to damage or repair based on actual repair values to converting to damage or repair based on theoretical repair values.</p>

<p>NPC Adjustment<br />
Except for sentry guns and CONCORD forces, the detection range of regular NPCs has been increased from approximately 250km to approximately 500km. NPCs will continuously pursue targets using regular flight.<br />
(Note: Currently, all NPCs only use flight to chase enemies and may initiate warp only when returning to the base center.)</p>

<p>Jump Clone Adjustment<br />
The cooldown time for using jump clone services has been reduced from 2 days to 1 day.<br />
The Infomorph Synchronizing skill's effect on reducing jump clone cooldown time has been enhanced from -25% / -15% / -10% to -20% / -30% / -40% (up to -90%).<br />
Adjusted the fees for jump clone services. Increased fees at lower clone points and reduced fees at higher clone points.</p>

<p>Sun Chaser Engine Adjustment<br />
When activating the Sun Chaser Engine in high sec and low sec areas, the warm-up time is reduced to 5 seconds.<br />
In high sec and low sec areas, the maximum jump range of the jump drive is increased by 100%.</p>

<p>Structure Adjustment<br />
The Corporation Frontline Outpost can be anchored in any system, with the reinforcement time rules changed to be identical to those of the Etherium Reach Region. The base time rules are:<br />
Saturday 00:00 - Monday 00:00 (UTC+0)<br />
If all adjacent systems within one jump are unclaimed, the reinforcement time can be set during the above time period.<br />
If multiple sovereignty structures exist in adjacent systems, the reinforcement time can only match any one of those structures.<br />
If the reinforcement time of structures in adjacent systems does not fall within the base time rules, the Frontline Outpost cannot be anchored.</p>

<p>Market Adjustment<br />
The PLEX sales tax rate is changed to 8%.<br />
Only players with a technology level of 10 can use the quick exchange feature to exchange for ISK. (Aiming to reduce behaviors such as third-party Black Card top-up and refund-based profit schemes)<br />
The station in the Tama Solar System has been upgraded to a Trading Center.</p>

<p>Insurance Adjustment<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Mk.I-Mk.IX standard modules has been adjusted to approximately 100% for Capsuleer's convenience, but they are no longer eligible for claim discounts.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Mk.I-Mk.VII Drones has been adjusted to 100%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Prototype Drones (i.e., Mk.IX) has been adjusted to approximately 75%.<br />
For Prototype Rigs has been changed to be non-compensable.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Standard Rigging I has been adjusted to 100%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Standard Rigging II has been adjusted to 75%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Standard Rigging III has been adjusted to 50%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Frequency-reducing Bipolar Integrated Rigging has been adjusted to 100%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Frequency-reducing 3P Integrated Rigging has been adjusted to 75%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for Frequency-reducing 4P Integrated Rigging has been adjusted to 50%.<br />
Insurance payout ratio for standard modules with Metalevel 5 that do not require manufacture has been adjusted to 100%.<br />
(Modules with Metalevel 5 that require manufacture have higher average prices and remain unchanged.)</p>

<p>After the adjustment, relevant market personnel will further monitor market supply and demand trends, and more adjustments will be made to modules with Metalevels 6-11 in the future.</p>

<p>Cosmic Anomaly Adjustment<br />
New Advanced Implant Units have been added as drops in Malpais.<br />
New module blueprints added to the Loot Crate in the Capital Ship Proving Grounds.<br />
New module blueprints added to the Advanced Inspector Cosmic Anomaly.<br />
The Solar System hosting the Relics Battle has been updated.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Optimizations</strong></span><br />
Optimized the AI Core to prevent it from immediately entering a new Cosmic Anomaly due to refresh delays.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></span><br />
Fixed an issue where the overheating threshold of the Thermal Circulation Control Unit was not properly raised synchronously.<br />
Fixed a display issue with the CyanSea Soaring Dragon Nanocore animation.<br />
Fixed an issue where the combat logs interface might only display partial records.<br />
Fixed an issue where the expiration time for the Laboratory series Encounter Missions might be shorter than 6 hours.<br />
Fixed an issue in Malpais where the Wasteseeker Centrum Cosmic Anomaly failed to correctly load the Acceleration Gate.<br />
Fixed an issue where blueprints producing multiple items incorrectly required multiple times the necessary materials under the dismantle list.<br />
Fixed the issue where it might be impossible to cancel after clicking the "Undock" button.<br />
Fixed the issue of abnormal bounty distribution when teaming up in Malpais.</p>
