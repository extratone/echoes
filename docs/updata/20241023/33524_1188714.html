                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">10/23/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span></strong> and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Ship</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Introducing 3 CONCORD ships: <span style="color:#f39c12;">Pacifier, Enforcer, and Marshal.</span><br />
Compared to the dedicated CONCORD models, these simplified versions strip away CONCORD's hyper-advanced fire control systems, defense systems, rapid deployment, and electronic warfare suites, making small-scale production possible.<br />
These ships can be fitted with turrets and missiles from the four major empires, featuring high-speed locking radar, decent defense performance, and rapid warp capabilities.<br />
After joining the Militia, Capsuleers can earn more Merits by piloting CONCORD ships to repel some enemies (such as Sleepers in the Relics).<br />
Based on the CONCORD insurance protocol, Capsuleers enjoy additional discounts when making insurance claims for CONCORD ships.<br />
<strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Pacifier</span></strong><br />
As an Advanced Covert Ops, in addition to having a high Analysis Success Rate and the ability to rapidly construct Spatial Rifts, it also has a specialized mid-slot that can be fitted with sniper or repair tactical modules, making it adaptable to various battlefields.<br />
<strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Enforcer</span></strong><br />
An Advanced Covert Recon Ship that can be fitted with a Covert Ops Cloaking Device and a Cynosural Field Generator, excelling at quickly approaching targets and intercepting them using a warp drive. In addition to sniper and repair tactical modules, it can also be fitted with rapid-firing or defense tactical modules.<br />
<strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Marshal</span></strong><br />
As an Advanced Covert Ops Battleship equipped with various cutting-edge technologies, it can detect Cynosural Signatures and jump to the battlefield quickly. With proficiency in warp, defense, and interception, it also has a specialized mid-slot that can be fitted with one of six conventional tactical modules, including sniper, repair, rapid-firing, defense, siege, and citadel tactical modules.<br />
Thanks to advanced electronic warfare technology, the Marshal can be fitted with the Shield Field Inhibitor or Armor Link Disruptor, effectively limiting the defensive tactics of enemy fleets.<br />
How to obtain: Obtain blueprints from the Militia Store and manufacture them (requires reaching a specified Rank before you can exchange for the blueprints)<br />
How to obtain (Event): Purchase at the Store</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">To thank Capsuleers for participating in the MMOS event, CONCORD has commissioned various ship manufacturers to upgrade the Enforcer Prototype ships owned by Capsuleers to the official version for free, significantly improving their overall performance. These ships will become unrestricted and open for Market Transaction.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;"><span style="font-size:22px;">New Modules</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Added 2 types of Tactical Disruptors that require advanced Electronic Warfare technical support to use. Currently, they can only be fitted on the Marshal ship.<br />
Shield Field Inhibitor<br />
Disrupts the target ship's shield field modules, making it difficult to constrain and enhance shield defense fields and causing a drop in its defense performance.<br />
Armor Link Disruptor<br />
Disrupts the target ship's armor connections, making it difficult to establish efficient links or enhance armor resistance and causing a drop in its overall defense performance.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased in the Guard Store</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Rigs: Light Fighter Siege Modification I-IV</span><br />
Comprehensively revamp the structure of regular carrier fighter systems to make them more suitable for large-scale sieges. Enhance the carrier's basic defense attributes and the firepower of Light Fighters.<br />
Compatible ships: Chimera, Nidhoggur, Archon, Thanatos, CyanSea<br />
How to obtain: Purchase at the Store or manufacture with industry</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Drone Control Command Update</span><br />
Added buttons for All Orbit, Return All, and Self-Repair commands to the operation interface popped up when dragging drones, fighters, and Lightweight Ships (collectively referred to as drones below) in space. Appropriate operation commands will be shown based on the drone type.<br />
Return All<br />
Issue the return command to all drones in space, instructing them to start flying towards the mothership. Once within the return range, they will attempt to return automatically. The Return command will not be interrupted by other commands.<br />
All Orbit<br />
Issue an orbit command to all drones in space, instructing them to approach and orbit the mothership. This is ineffective for drones in a return state. After adjusting the orbit range, you need to return the drones to the mothership and launch them again for them to orbit at the new radius.<br />
Self-Repair<br />
Only repair drones have this command. Upon issuing the command, the drone will attempt to repair the mothership.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Combat Value Display Update</span><br />
Added numerical displays for shield, armor, and structure repairs, including self-repair modules, remote repair modules, and implants.<br />
Added capacitor restoration, energy nosferatus and transfer, and energy neutralization displays, including Capacitor Warfare modules and implants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Sleeper Relics Update</span><br />
The Relics Scramble has been extended to December 31.<br />
Sleeper Relics are now changed to a two-level structure. Activating the acceleration gate on the first level will warp you to a random location near the beacon on the second level. Large, medium, and small ships correspond to three types of relics and can no longer activate gates smaller than their own tonnage.<br />
Defeating Sleeper enemies in the Relics can earn Merits (the Sleeper fleet's ranks include Private and a small number of Sergeants)<br />
When entering a system, if the system is at war, you will now receive a prompt. When the system's war state is about to end, a prompt will be issued in the chat interface 5 minutes in advance. Please avoid engaging with Capsuleers of other Militia during this period.<br />
The highest rank has been raised from Major to Brigadier General.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Balance Updates</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">When claiming insurance for freighters, their ship type has been adjusted from Regular Ship to Capital Ship<br />
The cooldown time for Add Bookmark has been increased to 1 minute<br />
It is no longer possible to move up to 1,000 items to the ship cargo hold at once<br />
Sniper Destroyer: Mid Slot +1. Sniper Mode removed. Can now fit the Sniper Tactical Module<br />
Sniper Cruisers: Specialized mid slot +1. Sniper Mode removed. Can now fit the Sniper Tactical Module.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Event</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Sky Patrol: Event Manual</span><br />
Event Duration: October 23, 2024, 08:00 - November 13, 2024, 08:00 (UTC+0)<br />

Note: Cosmic Treasure Opt Supply II contains Sky Patrol Lucky Draw Supply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Arrivals</span><br />
Sky Patrol Opt Supply. You have a chance to obtain the Marshal ship every time you open it. Opening up to 50 times will guarantee the Marshal ship.<br />
Light Fighter Siege Modification Supply. Open them to obtain Light Fighter Siege Modification IV and Integrated Light Fighter Blueprint Opt Supply.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Optimizations</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">New feature: Log On with NetEase Pass account<br />
Most Nanocore series exchange options are now available<br />
Now support searching by character numeric ID when looking up Contacts<br />
The Space Scan and Base Scan features now only require abnormal Scanning Authorization and no longer need Citadel Management authority</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Bug Fixes</span><br />
Fixed the issue where skills might not be removable after being added to the training queue<br />
