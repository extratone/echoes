                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#FF8C00;">5/8/2024 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span> and will take approximately <span style="color:#FF8C00;">120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00;">New Content</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Lucent-Moon Force Auxiliary</span><br />
Lucent-Moon, the Carrier co-designed by Capsuleers with Yue's assistance, has successfully embarked on its maiden voyage.<br />
Lucent-Moon has obtained special permission from CONCORD for operation in High-Sec areas.<br />
After incorporating the design proposals from the Capsuleers, Lucent-Moon will feature the following characteristics:<br />
Overload Engine: Lucent-Moon has an increased jump distance, but its fuel consumption is correspondingly higher.<br />
Energy Force Field Shield: The fruit of Yan-Jung technology. Significantly boost shield strength and the effectiveness of shield repair modules.<br />
Onboard Trajectory Calculation: Increase drone slots for Lucent-Moon, and increase drone flight velocity.<br />
How to obtain:<br />
Capsuleers may use Ship Blueprints and Data Materials to reverse-engineer the blueprint. They may then perform industrial manufacture with the required components detailed in the blueprint</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Hangar Expansion Refactoring</span><br />
With the help and effort of Yan-Jung and the joint design team, the new Yan-Jung Force Auxiliary can undergo hangar expansion refactoring modifications, with options to carry fighters or Lightweight Ships.<br />
Fighter Bay Hangar Expansion Refactoring<br />
Adjustments and refactoring are performed based on the existing hangar to improve fighter compatibility. However, after the rigging is complete, only fighters can be stationed aboard.<br />
Lightweight Ship Hangar Expansion Refactoring<br />
Specialized refactoring expansion for Lightweight Ships is performed based on the existing hangar. However, after the rigging is complete, only Lightweight Ships can be stationed aboard.<br />
How to obtain:<br />
Obtain from industrial manufacturing and event stores<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF8C00;">Yan-Jung Defense System Refactoring</span><br />
Engineer Sasaer has performed a defense system refactoring on Lucent-Moon based on Yan-Jung's Shield Energy Force Field Technology.<br />
Pilots can specialize Lucent-moon's defense system based on thier choice and tactical needs, including adjusting shield generator and armor plating ratio to adapt to different battlefields.<br />
How to Obtain<br />
Obtain from industrial manufacturing and event stores</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Lightweight Ship Hangar Modification</span><br />
Thanks to the efforts of Capsuleers and researchers, hangar modification technology has reached a milestone in its development. Now, it's possible to manufacture a new type of Lightweight Ship Hangar Modification System.<br />
The new model is an improvement and upgrade from the existing 6 experimental models. In addition to slot rigging, it also has the following effects:<br />
Increases Fighter Bay Capacity by 5,000-30,000<br />
Increases Ship Structure Hitpoints by 5%-30%</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Reverse Engineering</span><br />
Due to the supply and demand issues of certain experimental materials in the market, the new blueprint design will spend more ISK to reduce material consumption, with the following minor adjustments compared to the old blueprint:<br />
Reduced Imperial Device Construction Units and Device Improvement Carriers. Increased Device Compilation Optimization Carriers and increased ISK cost to 500 million. The total cost of Reverse Engineering is similar to the old blueprint.<br />
Reverse engineering and manufacturing of old blueprints are no longer supported. Ongoing projects are unaffected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Manufacture</span><br />
The types of capital ship components required for new blueprints remain the same, with a fixed quantity of 2 or 4, and no longer increase along with metalevel.<br />
Apart from capital ship components, significantly increased the ISK expenditure, significantly reduced the three salvaged materials, and slightly increased other materials. The total manufacturing cost is significantly reduced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Reprocess</span><br />
Old blueprints and hangar modification systems can be reprocessed, yielding the corresponding new blueprints or new hangar modification systems.<br />
Specifically, when reprocessing old hangar modification systems, 100% of the difference in the new and old requirements for capital ship components and the three significantly reduced salvaged materials will be refunded. This does not include ISK and materials with a slight increase in required quantities, and no deductions are needed.<br />
For example, for Bipolar Experimental Carrier Hangar Modification II, the number of capital ship components required is reduced from 12x4 to 4x4, so 8x4 capital ship components will be refunded. Its ISK cost is increased from 650 million to 3.2 billion, with no refunds or deductions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Delivery Feature</span><br />
Delivery centers at major empire stations have been completed, and the delivery feature is now available. In the initial phase, only Lancer Dreadnoughts and Versatile Assault Ships are supported.<br />
Delivery method:<br />
Repackage the ship, request delivery from the station menu, and you can spend ISK to instantly deliver the ship from High-Sec to the 6 major Low-Sec ITCs.<br />
Please note this will cost at least several hundred million ISK, and it's recommended to pilot them and leave High-Sec as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Corporation Insurance</span><br />
To improve the convenience of insurance claims and lessen the burden on Corporation Management, the insurance companies have introduced the Corporation Insurance feature.<br />
About Corporation Insurance<br />
If a Capsuleer has been in a Corporation for more than 30 days, they can open the combat logs interface to apply for Corporation Insurance compensation after their ship is destroyed. Leaving the Corporation or not being in a Corporation at the time of destruction will invalidate the claim.<br />
Management personnel with directorial rights can approve or reject the member's applications. Upon approving a claim, Corporation Insurance Points will be spent to compensate the applicant's ship.<br />
Upon successful compensation, the ship will be delivered to the station where the administrator approved the application, and ownership will automatically be transferred to the applying Corporation member.<br />
Corporation Insurance Points<br />
The Corporation Insurance Points Pack can be purchased at the Store. The contents of the packs will be updated with future events.<br />
Open the Corporation Insurance Points item menu while at a station to donate them to your Corporation. Note that this action is irreversible, and the record can be viewed in the Corporation Wallet logs.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Balance Updates</span></span></strong><br />
