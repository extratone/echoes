                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">To New Eden Capsuleers,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#f39c12;">1/15/2025 at 08:00 (UTC+0)</span> and will take approximately <span style="color:#f39c12;">120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Content</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Guardian Dreadnought</span><br />
As the battlefield environment grows grim, the four major empires urgently hoped for Dreadnoughts to enhance their all-around ability to counter ships of different tonnages. Thus, the Bodyguard Dreadnought, which adapts to the ever-changing combat situation, was born. Its feature is the ability to additionally equip capital ship close-in defense guns, significantly enhancing defense firepower against multiple small ships.<br />
The Bodyguard Dreadnought can fully utilize the performance of close combat weapons and dual-mounted close combat weapons. It has strong radar performance and is not easily disrupted.<br />
The Guardian-class Dreadnought is temporarily incapacitated from using the old series cores, but will be adapted in a future version.<br />
The Bodyguard Dreadnought can be equipped with 3 main weapons and 1 set of close-in defense guns.<br />
For the convenience of Capsuleers, CONCORD has issued temporary passes to these 4 ships. They are temporarily allowed to travel in High Sec before the maintenance on February 27 (UTC+0).<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Manufacture them based on the blueprints obtained via reverse engineering.<br />
How to obtain (Limited Time): Purchase from the Store's Hot Selection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Fleet Close-in Defense Gun</span><br />
A rapid-fire weapon system mounted on some of the extra-large ships used to detect and destroy approaching small ships and fighters. It automatically tracks and attacks targets with the help of smart fire control radar, commonly used for close-in defense.<br />
The Fleet Close-In Defense Gun features a dedicated high-speed identification system that automatically distinguishes between friendly fleet members, their drones, and hostile targets, ensuring precise and effective engagement against threats.<br />
With the assistance of this identification system, the close-in weapon can attack multiple targets simultaneously without relying on the mothership's targeting system. Continuous attacks on the same target can gradually improve strike accuracy and damage, but recalibration is needed when attacking a new target.<br />
Currently, only the Bodyguard Dreadnought supports this system and can fit 1 set of close-in defense guns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">The first batch includes the following 3 models:</span><br />
Versatile Fleet Close-in Gun that boasts balanced firepower and accuracy, capable of attacking ships and various drones (including fighters and lightweight ships).<br />
Anti-ship Fleet Close-in Gun that boasts higher firepower and lower accuracy but can only attack ships (including pirate ships and drones).<br />
Light Fleet Close-in Gun that boasts lower firepower and higher accuracy but can only attack drones (this is a showdown-specific model, ignoring pirate drones).<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased in the Loyalty Point Store.<br />
How to obtain (Limited Time): Purchase from the Store's Hot Selection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Alliance Close-in Defense Gun</span><br />
The Standup Close-in Defense Gun Array, designed for Alliance combat, has a core structure similar to the Fleet Close-in Gun. The difference lies in its integration with a high-speed Alliance identification system, allowing it to instantly identify and avoid Alliance members and their drones while attacking all other targets, supported by the structure office and mission network.<br />
The Standup Alliance Close-in Defense Gun features a fully independent high-speed identification system capable of autonomously searching for and attacking targets without relying on citadels or Fortizars. It lacks a diplomatic identification system, so caution is advised during operations.<br />
Currently, only the Fortizar is capable of fitting one Standup Alliance Close-in Defense Gun System. It includes three models: universal, anti-ship, and light.<br />
How to obtain: Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Skills</span><br />
Skills for Capital Close-in Defense Guns and Structure Close-in Defense Guns are now available, which, after training, can enhance weapon performance when operating arrays of Capital or Structure Close-in Defense Guns.<br />
How to obtain: Purchase and train with ISK.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Loyalist-class Destroyer</span><br />
An experimental Destroyer launched by CONCORD DED, designed to search for Pirate Bases in dangerous areas and deliver powerful strikes against Pirate Facilities.<br />
The Allegiance adheres to CONCORD's consistent design philosophy, boasting strong defense capabilities and powerful fire control radar. It prioritizes agility and Warp Drive over flight velocity, allowing flexible use of various Small Turrets and Missiles.<br />
On a tactical level, the Allegiance can be fitted with a Covert Ops Cloaking Device, Covert Cynosural Field Generator, Missile Launcher Bomb, Large Torpedo Launcher, and Bombard Tactics modules, allowing it to effectively strike large enemy targets.<br />
The Loyalist class can be fitted with 4 main Weapons and 1 Missile Launcher Bomb.<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Manufacture them based on the blueprints purchased in the Loyalty Point Store.<br />
How to obtain (Limited Time): Obtain from the Event Manual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Bombard Tactics Module</span><br />
Tactical modules that enhance the ship's long-range bombardment capabilities. Only ships supporting this technology can use it, and currently, only the Allegiance can be fitted with it. In the future, all Stealth Bombers will be adjusted and will be able to use it.<br />
How to obtain: Purchase from the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Loyalist Series Fighters</span><br />
Based on various technological achievements during the development of the Allegiance, the DED has simultaneously launched 3 types of fighters or lightweight ships.<br />
The "Guard" Light Attack Fighter is a new type of fighter incorporating various Allegiance technologies. It emphasizes agility over flight velocity, with high weapon accuracy, fast rate of fire, and low damage. With the aid of a new fire control radar, it can flexibly handle multiple small enemies, making it suitable for defending the mothership or providing long-range fire support.<br />
The "Iron Guard" Heavy Attack Fighter is the heavy model used by Supercarriers, with high defense, good agility, high weapon accuracy, and fast rate of fire, suitable for defending the mothership or providing long-range fire support against enemy capital ships.<br />
"The Lightweight Allegiance Destroyer, after undergoing lightweight modifications, has its tactical module and large devices such as the warp drive removed. Despite these changes, it maintains high defense capabilities and agility, allowing it to flexibly engage medium to close-range enemy targets.<br />
How to Obtain (Regular): Obtain from Wasteseeker Checkpoint and Wasteseeker Gravitational Wave Graph.<br />
How to Obtain (Limited Time): Obtain in the Home-returning Festival Store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Wandering Dragon Nanocore</span><br />
The brand new "Soaring Dragon" series Nanocore. The dragon's soar stirs the mountains, as its mighty thunder ushers in the spring for all.<br />
After activating the special mode, its attack can ignore part of the target's resistance at the cost of overloading its own capacitor, enhancing the damage output of various weapons while also providing additional protection against Weapon Disruption and Capacitor Warfare.<br />
How to Obtain (Limited Time): Redeem from the Dragonscale Store.<br />
The game client is currently undergoing an update audit, and Capsuleers are temporarily unable to customize the Nanocore effect colors. Once the new client passes the audit, Capsuleers can update the client to use this feature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Reactive Implant General Unit</span><br />
Added Reactive Implant General Units, with models ranging from V1.0 to V5.0. They can be fitted in Tactical Defense and other Neural Reaction Implants. Due to significant differences in technical principles, these units cannot be fitted in regular implants. The first batch includes the following models:<br />

How to Obtain (Limited Time): Obtain in the Home-returning Festival Store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Implant Reset</span><br />
As research into implants deepens, CONCORD has introduced a new type of Implant Reset Extractor, which can extract and restore the implants trained by Capsuleers and return a certain proportion of Compliers.<br />
The higher the quality of the Implant Reset Extractor, the higher the corresponding return ratio (up to 100%).<br />
Low-level implants are unstable, and direct extraction may cause harm to Capsuleers. Currently, only implants at level 25 and above (including level 25) are supported for reset.<br />
Note: Extracted Implants and returned Compilers are all Clone Bound items.<br />
How to Obtain (Regular): Redeem at the CONCORD Pass Shop.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Rank</span><br />
Ranks and Merits will no longer be cleared upon leaving the Militia, but they will be cleared after joining another faction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Corporation</span><br />
Corporation Missions and Store are now available to use even if Tech Level is below 7 (available 30 days after joining).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Alliance Sustention Fee</span><br />
The Alliance Sustention Fee has been updated. On top of the existing member size Sustention Fee, a Sovereignty size Sustention Fee has been added. This fee is influenced by the number of Sovereignty Systems occupied by the Alliance within the week. Details are as follows:<br />
0-30 Systems: No additional fee.<br />
31-40 Systems: Additional Fee = Total Number of Sovereignty Systems x 10 Million.<br />
41-50 Systems: Additional Fee = Total Number of Sovereignty Systems x 20 Million.<br />
And so on. That is when there are more than 30 Systems, for every additional 10 Systems, the weekly Sustention Fee for each Sovereignty System increases by 10 Million.<br />
For example, if a certain Alliance occupies 40 Sovereignty Systems, the additional Sustention Fee is 40 x 10 Million. If it occupies 41 Sovereignty Systems, the additional Sustention Fee is 40 x 20 Million.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">Optimizations</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">Optimized the hint for passing through the Klein Well in combat state.<br />
Optimized the hint for exceeding the price range when selling PLEX on the Market.<br />
Optimized the introduction of the Structure Jump Drive, now showing attributes such as Basic Jump Distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#f39c12;">Bug Fixes</span><br />
Fixed the issue where the Can-Yue Striker could not be fitted with Siege Tactical Modules.<br />
Fixed the issue where Corp and Alliance might not turn Neutral when the diplomacy count exceeded the max limit.<br />
Fixed the issue where Integrated Salvagers would salvage rewards or Trapper mechanisms.</span></p>
