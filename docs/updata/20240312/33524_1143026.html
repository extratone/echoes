                  <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Dear pilots of New Eden,&nbsp;<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#FF8C00;">3/13/2024</span> <span style="color:#FF8C00;">at 08:00 (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes</span> to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Balance Update</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">To improve capsuleer’s experience and enrich the gameplay strategy, we are planning to introduce a series of balance updates. For the current update, there will primarily be adjustments to skills, ships, and implants, aiming to reduce the learning and piloting costs of some advanced ships.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Skills</span><br />
Shield Hardening: Adaptive Invulnerability Field duration adjusted from +15%/10%/5% to +20%/15%/15%; Reactive Shield Hardener duration adjusted from +15%/10%/5% to 0/0/-10%; Reactive Shield Hardener capacitor consumption adjusted from -15%/-10%/-5% to -25%/-20%/-20%<br />
Armor Hardening: Adjusted in the same manner as the Shield Hardening skill<br />
(Tips: Reactive Shield Hardener automatically adjusts its resistance with each activation. The shorter the activation time, the better)<br />
Shield Harmonizing Theory series skills: Signature Radius penalty adjusted from -10%/-15% to -20%/-25%<br />
Remote Shield Reinforcement Array Theory: Shield Boost bonus increased from +5% to +7.5%<br />
Remote Shield Transmission Array Theory: Accuracy Falloff bonus increased from +10% to +15%<br />
Armor Layering series skills: Quality penalty adjusted from -10%/-15% to -20%/-25%<br />
Remote Armor Reinforcement Array Theory: Increased the repair amount bonus from +5% to +7.5%<br />
Remote Armor Transmission Array Theory: Optimal Range bonus increased from +10% to +15%<br />
Structure Missile Operation: Damage bonus increased from +20%/10%/10% to +20%/25%/30%<br />
Structure Missiles Upgrade: Damage bonus increased from +15%/10%/10% to +20%/25%/30%, missile velocity increased from +4%/3%/3% to +10%/7.5%/7.5%, and flight time increased from +10%/5%/5% to +10%/7.5%/7.5%<br />
Expert Damage Transfer Theory: Increased the damage transfer ratio from +5% to +7.5%<br />
Expert Chip Manufacture: Increased the material efficiency from +5% to +10%</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Skill Training</span><br />
As the number of specialization skills increases, the cost of obtaining skills through the Lucky Chest will gradually increase for capsuleers. We hope to provide a more convenient way to train in skills.<br />
How to Purchase: Open the Skill interface and purchase directly using Pass Points or ISK<br />
Price Range: The price generally ranges from 36000~60000 Pass Points<br />
Skills Available for Purchase: All specialization skills in the 4 Skill Lucky Chests in the CONCORD <span style="color:#FF8C00;">Pass Shop</span><br />
Note: Expert Skills, Auto Salvage Technology, and Cognitive Neuroscience, which are not available in the CONCORD Pass Shop, cannot be purchased<br />
In addition, after the maintenance on 1 May, the Skill Lucky Chest in the CONCORD Pass Shop will no longer be available, and any purchased Lucky Chests and Chips can still be traded or used. The jump to CONCORD Pass Shop button in the Skill interface will be hidden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Ship Bonus Optimization</span><br />
We’ve adjusted several ships with a more complicated bonus system to improve their initial combat capability for capsuleers with insufficient skill training, reducing the difficulty in understanding them. On the premise of keeping their power unchanged, we reduced the excessive dependency between skills and the ship, turning some effects into basic effects of advanced ships and modules, and reduced the skill requirements.<br />
Versatile Assault Ship: Bonuses related to the Mothership Defense Module are now a base effect of the module and are not dependent on any skills<br />
Versatile Assault Ship: All bonuses related to Lightweight Ship are now affected by the Lightweight Ships skill, and other bonuses are now affected by the Versatile Assault Ship Operation skill<br />
Rorqual: Logistics Drone bonus is now affected by Capital Industrial Ships skill<br />
Nestor: All bonuses related to drones are now affected by the Large Drone Operation skill</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Ship Description Optimization</span><br />
To further reduce the learning costs of capsuleers and minimize unnecessary information, we have also optimized the descriptions for ships.<br />
"Jump drive available" is now hidden, and ships that can jump will now show information such as jump range<br />
"Warp Acceleration" is now hidden, but it will still be applied. This is commonly seen in Angel ships<br />
"Jump Drive warm-up time" is now hidden, as jump drives can generally be activated without preheating<br />
"Can fit Fighter Rigs" is now hidden<br />
"Can fit Hangar Rigs" is now hidden<br />
"Can fit Supercarrier Cover Module" is now hidden<br />
"Can only be fitted to some carriers" for Mothership Defense Module is now hidden<br />
Deceleration Resistance’s text was adjusted to "Stasis Webifier Resistance". Its actual function remains unchanged. This resistance has no effect on certain deceleration effects, such as the gradual deceleration of Stasis Grappler</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Store Adjustment</span><br />
To improve capsuleer’s experience and reduce the decision-making and learning cost, CONCORD has adjusted or made unavailable some items in the store:<br />
Made unavailable the Implant Material S/L Bundle and Combatant Supplies - Novice/Advanced items from the Recommended tab<br />
The Ship SKIN store has been temporarily closed, and all SKINS have been made unavailable<br />
The Implant Development store has been temporarily closed, and all Neural Compilers have been made unavailable<br />
New Item in the Recommended Tab: Ascension Neural Compiler</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;">In addition, to reduce the impact of some items on the PLEX market and make it easier for capsuleers to purchase Omega Clones, thereby returning PLEX to its core use, we are making the following adjustments to some PLEX items.<br />
Changed the "General Nano Source III" and "Cloud AI Learning Code Refactoring Permission III" in the Nanocore tab to be purchasable with AUR and lowered their prices<br />
Changed the Secret Trafficking Decoding Credentials in the Underground Market tab to be purchasable with AUR, and lowered its price<br />
For more details, please visit the Store. In the future, we will make optimization to more Store (CONCORD Pass, Scholar Point Exchange, and more) and PLEX items.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Anti-Cheat Announcement</span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">To best protect the legitimate interests of all capsuleers, the development team has always taken a firm stance against the production, sale, and use of cheats. Recently we discovered some players were profiting by modifying the system environment and completing encounter missions, which violates the user agreement and impacts the interests of other players.<br />
To improve game fairness, we have decided to prohibit logging into the game using rooted or jailbroken devices after the maintenance on March 20, which will take some time to implement. Please ensure that you log in using untampered devices, Capsuleers.<br />
At the same time, the development team has taken legal action against cheat providers and developers to protect our rights and crack down on their activities. We welcome players to report any violations through in-game reporting or the customer service center and create a better gaming environment for everyone.</span></p>
