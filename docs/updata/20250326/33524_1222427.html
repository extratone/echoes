                  <p>To New Eden Capsuleers,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on <span style="color:#f39c12;">3/26/2025 at 08:00 (UTC+0) </span>and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Features</strong></span><br />
Mining AI Core<br />
To improve the mining experience, CONCORD has partnered with ORE to introduce the Mining AI Core.<br />
Capsuleers can upgrade the Nanocore of specialized mining ships to AI Core and enable the Local Star System Mining feature in the settings.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Feature Introduction</strong></span><br />
Capsuleers need to enter a station or citadel of the current System and set it as their mining base in Station Services.<br />
In the Nanocore Settings interface, select the "Current System Mining" function.<br />
After setting up, exit the station and activate the Mining AI Core. The ship will automatically search for Asteroid Belts and mine ore.<br />
Once fully harvested, the ore will be transported to the pre-set mining base, moved to the station hangar, and then the ship will exit the station to start mining again. (Any operation at this time will interrupt mining)<br />
Docking Access: If the Capsuleer no longer has access to the citadel, the Mining AI Core will try to go offline.<br />
(Actual functionality subject to change upon release)</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Supported Ships</strong></span><br />
Rorqual, Orca, Covetor II, Covetor, Procurer, Retriever, Venture Covert Ops, Venture IV<br />
Due to the low mining efficiency of lower-tier Venture ships, which cannot cover the cost of using AI Cores, and the ease with which exploiter groups can obtain these ships, other models of lower-tier Venture ships currently do not support the activation of the mining assistance feature.<br />
In the future, we will introduce a verification code feature to further combat illegal groups and create a fairer gaming environment.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Supported Nanocores</strong></span><br />
The first batch of supported Nanocores includes the Neon Gas and Illusionary Ghost series, with other series gradually being added with this feature.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Use Restrictions</strong></span><br />
Currently, this feature is in the experimental stage, and the demand for ore in Construction and Market is lower compared to other materials. To reduce the impact of productivity increase on the market, the mining assistance feature is limited to running for only 4 hours a day.<br />
Subsequent adjustments will be introduced to gradually optimize the design of Construction blueprints, and usage restrictions will be adjusted as needed to align with combat assistance feature.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Nanocore SKIN Sharing</strong></span><br />
Once the Nanocore data has been successfully uploaded to the Data Bank, Capsuleers can then change the current fitting's Nanocore SKIN to any Nanocore SKIN compatible with the same model ship from the Data Bank.<br />
For example, if the currently installed core is the "Neon Rain Machariel" core, once the "Blue-and-White Porcelain Machariel" core SKIN is uploaded to the Data Bank, you can change the appearance of the "Neon Rain" core to the "Blue-and-White Porcelain" style. However, if all "Blue-and-White Porcelain Machariel" Nanocores are downloaded from the Data Bank, your Nanocore SKIN will revert to the "Neon Rain" style.<br />
Notes: If the SKIN sharing is not effective. Please try to download the Nanocore and re-upload it to the Data Bank.</p>

<p>Removed the "Exogenous Light Radiation Recombination Device" cost to change Nanocore SKINs.<br />
The "Exogenous Light Radiation Recombination Device" will be open for reprocessing, allowing Capsuleers to reprocess it them into varying quantities of "General Nano Source III".</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Etherium Reach Update</strong></span><br />
Corporation Reconnaissance Outposts can anchor in the Etherium Reach region, with enhancement rules similar to anchoring in the Cobalt Edge.<br />
In the Etherium Reach Region, each System has a chance for a Wasteseeker Base to spawn. Defeating it can yield generous rewards (including Datacores, Drone Blueprints, Implant units, and more)<br />
In Systems with Sovereignty Structures, if a Wasteseeker Base is not destroyed for more than 3 days, it will dispatch a Wasteseeker Siege Fleet to attack the Sovereignty Structures. If the Base is destroyed beforehand, the Siege Fleet will not be dispatched.<br />
After attacking a Structure and reduce it to the Reinforcement state, the Wasteseeker Siege Fleet will not leave but will wait until the Reinforcement Hour ends to continue attacking the Structure until it is destroyed. Therefore, it is necessary to repel the Wasteseeker Siege Fleet in time or destroy the Wasteseeker Base at an earlier time.</p>

<p>Capsuleer Scout Outposts can also be anchored in the Etherium Reach Region, and Wasteseeker Bases will not dispatch Fleets to attack these small Structures.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Advanced Inquisitor Cosmic Anomaly Update</strong></span><br />
The Cosmic Anomaly's number of levels have been adjusted from 3 and 5 levels to 2 and 3 levels, reducing combat difficulty and time spent. The overall spawn rate of Inquisitor Cosmic Anomalies has been increased.<br />
Increased the relative spawn rate of Advanced Inquisitor Cosmic Anomalies, while the relative spawn rate of old Cosmic Anomalies has been reduced.<br />
The Rank of the Factions' corresponding pirates will now be shown (such as Guristas Sergeant, Guristas Captain).<br />
Increased the rate of obtaining Neural Reaction Units from Loot Crates.</p>

<p>Note: The number of levels in the Inquisitor Cosmic Anomaly is related to the Pirate Base level. If the Pirate Base is under Level 6, the Inquisitor Cosmic Anomaly will only have 2 levels (same as High-Sec).</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Unknown Covert Rift Update</strong></span><br />
Currently, the number of additional rift routes generated by unknown covert rifts is excessive, with a low destruction rate, making it time-consuming to destroy them all. After opening the Star Charts in the Null-Sec Region, a significant amount of invalid Klein Well information is likely to appear, cluttering the screen. To enhance the combat experience, the following adjustments have been implemented:<br />
The number of additional affiliate routes has been reduced from 3 to 2.<br />
The fuel usage for scans has been reduced from 720,000 to 640,000.<br />
The maximum duration of the Cosmic Anomaly has been reduced from 3 days to 2 days.</p>

<p>Note: The destruction rate in the Capital Ship Testing Ground is extremely high, and the number is far less than covert rifts, so no adjustments have been made. There are only adjustments to covert rifts discovered by Corporation scanning.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Alliance Sustention Fee Update</strong></span><br />
Member Size Sustention Fee (Increased)<br />
(1-15 Corps: Fee remains unchanged)<br />
16-20 Members: Increased from Number of Corps x 100 Million to Number of Corps x 200 Million<br />
21-25 Members: Increased from Number of Corps x 300 Million to Number of Corps x 600 Million<br />
26-30 Members: Increased from Number of Corps x 500 Million to Number of Corps x 1 Billion<br />
Sovereignty Sustention Fee (Reduced)<br />
For Alliances with more than 30 Sovereignty Systems, the increase per 10 Sovereignty Systems will be reduced from 10 Million ISK to 7.5 Million ISK.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Corporation Diplomacy Update</strong></span><br />
When a Corporation joins an Alliance, the friendly and hostile alliances set by the Corporation will become invalid, and there will be no need to pay the diplomacy sustention fee related to the Alliance (note: this will take effect the following week).<br />
When a Corporation quits an Alliance, the friendly and hostile alliances set by the Corporation will become effective again.<br />
When a Corporation sets other Capsuleers as hostile, their applications to join will be automatically declined.<br />
Capsuleers cannot add Corporations and Alliances as contacts, and any set friendly relationships will also become invalid. If needed, you can add their managers as contacts.<br />
(Note: Corporations can still set a Capsuleer as friendly or hostile.)</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Emergency Hull Energizer Assistance Feature</strong></span><br />
To reduce the occurrence of failing to activate the Emergency Hull Energizer due to network fluctuations and other issues, an assistance feature has been introduced.<br />
In the "Settings - Battle Settings" interface, a new option has been added: once the ship structure hitpoints drops below a certain percentage, activate Emergency Hull Energizer automatically?<br />
Capsuleers can configure the activation of the assistance feature as needed and adjust the structure hitpoints trigger number accordingly.<br />
Note: This is the last resort for protection, and there will be delay to this feature. In case of danger, please prioritize activation of it manually.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Fighter Classification and Close-in Defense Gun Update</strong></span><br />
New category added to the Overview: Fighters. Pirate fighters, drones, lightweight ships, and some weaker small ships will be included in this category.<br />
Meanwhile, the target-seeking logic of the Close-In Defense Gun has been simplified as follows:<br />
Versatile Close-In Defense Gun now attacks both ships and fighters.<br />
Anti-Ship Close-In Defense Gun now attacks only ships.<br />
Light Close-in Defense Gun now attacks only fighters.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>New Advanced Units</strong></span><br />
Exclusive Advanced Units added for Multifrequency Crystal and Kinetic Burst.<br />
Multifrequency Crystal Flight Time Enhancement: An advanced unit that further enhances the flight time of multifrequency crystals. Reduce the capacitor consumption of weapons and repair modules, and the higher level advanced units can also increase the strength of capacitor neutralization effects.<br />
Kinetic Burst Precision Enhancement: An advanced unit that further enhances aiming accuracy in Kinetic Burst state. Increase weapon tracking speed and fatal blow damage multiplier, and extends the duration of Weakness Avoidance.<br />
How to Obtain 1 (not available yet): Obtainable from Loot Crate in the Wasteseeker Centrum after 2 weeks.<br />
How to Obtain 2: Upgraded to a higher version through Reverse Engineering using lower version units.<br />
How to obtain (Event): Purchase from the Store's Hot Selection, which is available for a limited time.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Research Series Nanocore</strong></span><br />
The new Research Series Nanocores have been added. Although they lack secondary attributes, they can parse various AI Core attribute entries. The first batch of adaptable tonnage includes Dreadnoughts, Carriers, and Battleships.<br />
To reduce the access difficulty of AI Core attribute entries, the pricing of the Research Series Cores is lower, but the number of corresponding parsed entries is accordingly recduced.<br />
How to obtain (Event): Purchase from the Store's Hot Selection, which is available for a limited time.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Stellar Clash</strong></span><br />
Currently, there are More instances of improper score farming, and numerous reports require multiple reviews. To ensure the fairness and integrity of the reward mechanism for the "Stellar Clash" event, we will conduct a supplementary review of the current Public Announcement data for two weeks.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Recommended New Arrivals</strong></span><br />
The Illusionary Ghost Series Nanocore and the Star of Trailblazers - Carrier Encrypted Transport Container is back for a limited time.<br />
The new Unit Draw Supply is now available/ Open them for a chance to obtain the new Advanced Units.<br />
The Research Series Nanocore is now available. It can analysis and yield various AI Core attribute entries.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Optimizations</strong></span><br />
Optimized the Combat Log interface's performance when dealing with a large number of items, improving loading speed.<br />
Added notifications when the special effects of certain Implants are triggered, including those for Support Projection and Automatic Defense.<br />
Optimized the relationship display for all drones, fighters, and lightweight ships. In addition to fleet relationships, Corporation, Alliance, and diplomatic relationships are now also displayed.<br />
Optimized the description of the Ore Compression Interface.<br />
Hide the "Social Science - Corporation Management" category in the Skills Interface.<br />
Optimized the display format of diplomacy sustention fees when the amounts are high.<br />
Optimized the names and descriptions of certain items.<br />
Optimized the level display effect in the Corporation Business Card Interface.<br />
Optimized the merit acquisition notification, and it no longer appears when the value is 0.<br />
Optimized the orientation of Klein Wells in certain Rift Space.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></span><br />
Fixed the issue of Corporation Citadel upgrade time being too long.<br />
Fixed an issue where the chat interface had a rare chance of not displaying properly.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Ship Warp Speed Adjustment</strong></span><br />
