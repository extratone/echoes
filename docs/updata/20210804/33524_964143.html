                Anniversary Update Overview (8/5 Version)
                  <p class="date">2021-08-04</p>
              </div>
              <div class="artCon">
                  <p><span style="font-size:18px;">In YC122, a group of clone pilots anchored the first capsuleer space station in nullsec of EVE Echoes Universe. YC123 is destined to be a remarkable year. The Sisters of EVE brought more life into New Eden by developing the resonance wave technology in the first half of the year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In the second half of the year, the CONCORD is committed to welcoming more capsuleers into New Eden, so they have started a new Training Tutorial. New pilots who join New Eden will receive a more comprehensive pilot training program from the CONCORD.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">New capsuleers usually panic due to their inexperience in combat when facing the brutal environment of lowsec/nullsec. The Independent Gaming Commission has established a mechanism of Faction Warfare simulation --- Faction Wargames --- to help new capsuleers get used to New Eden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The Sisters of EVE have also upgraded their resonance wave simulation technology, which can now discover a series of further hidden locations of Data and Relic Sites</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In order to welcome the arrival of a brand-new parallel universe of EVE Echoes, the Scope has also prepared a series of grand events for all capsuleers.</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">1. Faction Wargames</span></strong></em><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp;<br />
In order to adapt to progressive war dynamics, the naval departments of Amarr, Caldari, Minmatar, and Gallente have installed a Faction Wargames simulator system. Capsuleers can join the simulated battle at any NPC-owned station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">You can hone and polish your combat skills without worrying about losing your own ship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Capsuleers who meet the requirements can participate in training and earn LP, which can be redeemed for selected rewards at the Wargame Exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">To join a battle, use the menu at the lower-right corner on the station interface and select training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In Faction Wargames, each capsuleer will be randomly assigned a faction and will need to fight against capsuleers from the other faction.<br />
<br />
The experimental map prepared for the simulation training is called The Shattered Belts, where capsuleers mainly intercept and destroy enemy NPC industrial ships.<br />
<br />
Capsuleers can currently choose from frigates and destroyers provided by the Commission, which are provided free of charge most of the time.<br />
<br />
There is currently no plan to add bot players to the mode.</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">2. Wargame Exchange</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">To encourage capsuleers to use the Faction Wargames to receive more training, various organizations have donated special models of test-type modules, nanocores, drones, and ship reverse-engineering materials to be given as rewards.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Specific Rewards Include:<br />
Non-tradeable CONCORD test-type modules. These modules each have a different strength, but as they are test-types, they cannot be traded in the market or through contracts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Empire Drones.<br />
Sisters of EVE and Mordu's Legion Damaged Hulls.<br />
Nanocores from ships of the Four Empires.<br />
Other Rewards</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">3. Brand Training Tutorial</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">Organizations have been placing great emphasis on raising the skill levels of new capsuleers as well as recruiting new ones.<br />
<br />
New capsuleers will receive improved guidance, and CONCORD has organized peripheral personnel to create teams to assist new capsuleers so that they can understand better and participate more fully in New Eden.<br />
<br />
We hope capsuleers will collaborate more, as New Eden can only prosper with the efforts of all of its people. Our wish is for more people to join the EVE Echoes universe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In the new training program, you will experience the piloting of ships, using various modules, learning survival skills, etc., and as well as the chance to look for every opportunity to grow as a capsuleer.<br />
<br />
The current tutorial is still a beta version and only contains some basic tutorials. The lore surrounding this will continue to be written to bring everyone a better experience.</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">4. Corporation Sovereignty Support Structures</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px;">With the rapid development of various factions in nullsec, several industrial giants begin to see new business opportunities. Upwell upgraded the design of corporation citadels and also launched a variety of support structures to fill the infrastructure construction gap across various areas.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Upgraded corporation citadels provide a certain amount of Energy Anchor Points which supply the fuel needed for various support structures.<br />
<br />
Blueprints for the following support structures are available in the market:<br />
<br />
Assembly Workshop: Produces ships at a higher efficiency.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Tax Center: Provides corporations with extra benefits when capsuleers defeat pirates in the system.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Bounty Management Center: Provide capsuleers with additional bounty when they defeat pirates in the same system.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Pirate Detection Array: A device that detects pirates in the system： can detect additional pirate strongholds, and can mark the first capsuleer that fought in an anomaly.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Station Lab: A special physics lab that improves the success rate of the reverse-engineering of deadspace modul</span><span style="font-size:18px;">es.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Analytical Computer: A sophisticated computer that improves the success rate of reverse-engineering ship blueprints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Capsuleers can place support structures, as well as raise their level and bonuses in corporation citadels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">A record of members' donations and construction will be kept permanently, and a list of all members who have contributed can be accessed on the corporation citadel page (a change of sovereignty will not change the list).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Upgrading a corporation citadel to level 2 will bring a significant increase in defensive capabilities, and a change of sovereignty will not completely destroy this structure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">To meet the needs of the new citadel battle, a special module Entosis Link is required to capture citadels that have lost their structure. After the citadel has been captured, it will re-enter Hull Reinforcement mode.</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span style="font-size:20px;">5. Discovery of Data and Relic Sites</span></em></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Many factions have a number of Data and Relic sites in various corners of New Eden which rarely get discovered. To discover these, the Sisters of EVE have upgraded their resonance wave technology and developed additional two analyzers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Capsuleers can install two types of analytical module and resonance wave tech on their ships to detect these locations, enter them and find valuable loot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">We have provided Data Analyzers and Relic Analyzers which can be used to analyze encrypted containers in Data and Relic Sites. Currently, these containers are poorly encrypted, so there's no need to manually decrypt them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Data Decryptors, which can adjust the material/time efficiency of productions, or success rate of reverse engineering, can be excavated from these locations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Some of these special Decryptors can improve the efficiency of the industrial process, allowing industrial jobs to yield more products. As a result, more production material is wasted, but it consumes less blueprints or ship wrecks. Capsuleers can choose according to their habits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">A new kind of integrated rigging module can also be found in these locations, which can integrate 2 to 4 modifiers of the same type under one module. Please note that the riggings' effect will be generally reduced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The blueprints of these modules can be found in Data Nexuses, and their materials found in Relic Locations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Currently Pender Insurance pays for integrated riggings when they have an estimate price for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">These locations are hidden in various areas on New Eden and are currently unguarded. But don't take these locations for granted - other capsuleers can also enter these areas through scan analysis and plunder the loot.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>6. Anniversary Celebrations</strong></span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In order to welcome the arrival of a brand-new year in the parallel universe, as sponsor, the Scope has also prepared a series of grand events for all capsuleers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Event Server Reward: All capsuleers taking part in the celebration will to contribute to the event. Whenever the progress reaches a new goal, all capsuleers will be eligible to receive special commemorative items and other rewards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">We have also added a celebration pass that is divided into two parts: anniversary rewards and advanced rewards. You can pay AUR to unlock the advanced rewards, and complete celebration missions to get the pass reward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Earn Celebration Tokens by participating in events and exchange them for rewards in the Exchange Store!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The Exchange Store have prepared Celebration Nanocores, Industrial Decryptor Supply Chests, Integrated Rigging Blueprint Supply Chests, Celebration SKIN, Skill Points, Insurance Points and Lucky Vouchers to be exchanged!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The capsuleer bonus has been updated with some extra supplies to help capsuleers who had left New Eden to return and keep up with their progress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Lucky Capsuleer Ticket exchanged with Celebration Tokens in the Event Exchange Store can be used to obtain rare rewards including Celebration exclusive Nanocore and celebration SKIN.</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">7. Rift of Era - Treasury Nihilus Space</span></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Some pirate forces have a special batch of SKINs to be shipped out, which had been hidden in a special Nihilus Space rift. They wanted to transport the SKIN to highsec, but were discovered by an agent. As the agent announced their space signal key, the major factions established channels to this special Nihilus Space, now known as the Rift of Era.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">From August 5 to August 25, the Rift of Era may appear in all regions in New Eden. Capsuleers can detect the passages through resonance wave technology, and head to the Rift of Era via these passages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The Rift consists of passages and Supernova Non-safe Spots. Capsuleers from different areas will be able to enter non-safe points via passages, and will need to defeat pirates to collect loot nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">You can get Anniversary Tokens and SKIN supply boxes, which can be opened for permanent SKIN.</span></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">8. Freighter Raid</span></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Pirate raids have long been a problem for ORE, so they plan to purchase some combat equipment so they can arm a convoy to fight against pirate forces. They are calling this plan Hunt of Vengeance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Here are the details of the plan:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">ORE has hired a market operator to exchange 30,000 PLEX for ISK in the market in advance, and used the ISK to acquire a large number of supplies. The supplies were originally planned for use against the pirates, but have now placed in the freighter and are to be given out as rewards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">After the purchase has been completed, ORE will use a special cargo ship to transport these supplies every day. These cargo ships will pretend to trade with pirates, so there will be pirate officials on the cargo ship to check the supplies and initiate the trade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">ORE will reveal this information to the capsuleers, in the hope they can assist ORE in destroying these freighters and the pirate officers. The pirate officers will die when the freighters are destroyed, their Lv.4 officer modules may drop, or get destroyed as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Both the pirate officer and the large number of supplies acquired by the market operator will be on the ship. ORE have announced they will gift the capsuleer who receives the killmail for that frigate with the Lv.3 pirate modules which they acquired with a high price.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">SCC has listed all these officer modules as tradeable via contract, so whoever gets these modules can trade them freely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">ORE has hired 4 special capsuleers to ride these frigates, and will stream the event. But in order to stop the pirates from discovering their plan, the location data will be blocked from the stream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">They are recruiting interested capsuleers to participate in the plan and help complete this operation. Capsuleers can get hints from the stream such as the universe background, and figure out the location.</span></p>
