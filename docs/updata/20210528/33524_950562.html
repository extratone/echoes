<p><span style="font-size:18px;">As scanning is extremely important part of our upcoming Exploration update (early June), we'd like to share a basic introduction of scanning.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">What is Resonance Simulation?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In the original EVE universe, the process of probe scanning was to use probes to analyze specific areas, increasing the intensity of the probes by continually narrowing their detection range, and thus eventually locating different celestials, ships, and other objects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">During the supernova event, the parallel universe Echoes emerged. The supernova also produced a large number of special neutrinos. Shortly thereafter, people in the parallel universe discovered a special resonance effect that occurs when such neutrinos pass through different objects, an effect that can be recognized as a new kind of signal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The sources of these signals are very diverse. It can come from a celestial or a ship: it occurs as long as such neutrinos exist. Since then, CONCORD, in conjunction with the Four Empires and the Sisters, have been analyzing these signals and named this type of signal Neutrino Resonance Wave, or NRW for short. Later analysis of this signal showed that neutrino resonances from different sources have different oscillation characteristics and the distance decay effect is negligible, so an instrument was built to record and display the analysis of the received signal. That instrument is the Resonance Simulator.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">Making Use of Resonance Simulation</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">There are two types of Resonance Simulators developed so far: wide and narrow. These two instruments work using the same principle, but the Wide Resonance Scanner is used to analyze signals being emitted from ships and structures, while the Narrow Resonance Scanner detects signals being emitted from potential beacons, which may lead into anomalies. The Narrow Resonance Scanner can only detect the signal waves emitted by buildings/ships and can analyze specific information about them, such as the type of ships, etc. The Wide Resonance Scanner, however, is built for analyzing possible beacon signals under different astronomical conditions, and has a wider acceptance range, but the accuracy of the analysis will be slightly less than that of the one that analyzes narrow signal waves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">And for the objects that have been analyzed so far, researchers have calculated the radius of the source based on the strength of the signal at the time it was scanned; the larger the source radius, the stronger the signal wave emitted.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">1. How does the scanning work from a PvE perspective? What kinds of signals can be detected?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Resonance Simulation used for PvE has many different signals, including ones emitted by Deadspace anomalies. You will need to have the Wide Resonance Scanner fitted, and by activating this module in outer space, you will receive reports on anomalous astronomical signals from different regions of the current system after a period of time. After the scan is complete, players can tap the notice on the screen to check the scan report and analysis.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">2. How does scanning work in PvP? How can I pick up signals?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The Resonance Simulator used for PvP can only scan player ships and structures. Firstly, you have to fit the Narrow Resonance Scanner on your ship. Activate the module in outer space to receive different signal reports that show the ships in the current system after a short period of time. Later on, you can tap the notice on the screen to check the scan report and analysis.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">3. Detailed Scanning Process</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">When you activate the module, different signal waves will be detected, and all detected signals will be displayed. The waves seen in the next screen will be an overlay of possible anomalous beacon/ship waveforms and noise from other celestials (such as stars or planets). Since the module itself cannot filter all possible noise, you will need to filter out specific waves. If the noise has been successfully filtered out, the module can then perform a data simulation of the noiseless signal wave with the data currently available to extract additional information behind the signal wave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">For example, when using the Wide Resonance Scanner, there are five potential different types of signal interferences (noise), and after the Capsuleer eliminates two of the noise signals that interfere with the analysis, the module will automatically perform a simulation that gives an analysis of the noiseless signal wave. The module will go through a significant number of calculations each time it performs a filtering/inclusion of noise, so when the number of analyses performed reach the limit, you will have to wait on the module to recover first before performing another analysis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What Resonance Simulation Wil Bring to the Game</strong></span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">1. Why did you move Deadspace anomalies to the new scanning system?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">As the most advanced anomalies, Deadspace is supposed to be more difficult to discover. We always had a plan to make Deadspace exclusive to scanning. If you find that the number of anomalies appearing is below your expectations, just give Resonance Simulation a try. It will show you hidden anomalies.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">2. Why is Nihilus Space also exclusive to scanning?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Nihilus Space is linked to our galaxy through many unstable areas. The gateways to these spaces absorb other particles, and their energy keeps the space beyond our known space out of existence for a short time. During this energy transformation, only neutrino resonance will continue to propagate as residual cosmic signatures in our known space, emanating information about the gateways everywhere.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">3. Allowing scan in low-secs will affect the current playing pattern. Why did you do that?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">In the low security areas in EVE games, players are only protected by CONCORD or the Four Empires when they are close to Stargates. The other places are supposed to be very dangerous. We fixed the low-sec gate camp issue because we want to prevent players from being destroyed when autopiloting under the protection of Stargate Cannons. Despite that, the current low-sec environment is too safe. We want these areas to actually be low security.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">Preventing Yourself from Detection</span></strong></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">1. What should I do to prevent my ship from being detected in lowsec and nullsec? What should I do if I am detected?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">If you are scouting and don't want to be detected, you can choose a Covert Ops ship fitted with stealth modules to prevent your ship from being detected. Ships with a lower Source Radius also help you stay undiscovered. We will also be introducing some new defensive modules that can lower your ship's Source Radius.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:18px;">2. Will I receive any alerts upon being scanned?</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">If the scanner's Detection Radius is less than or equal to the Source Radius of the scanned ship, the scanned ship won’t receive any alerts. If the scanner's Detection Radius is larger than or equal to the Source Radius of the scanned ship, the scanned ship will receive an alert similar to one received when under attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><em>3. What should I do if I'm playing the storyline missions in lowsec and want to avoid detection? What should I do if I am detected?</em><br />
When playing storyline missions, if you don't want to be detected, you should always keep an eye on the Local Player List. If there are multiple players online, a timely retreat is your best option. It is also recommended to have warp-stabilizing modules to prevent interference by possible Warp Scramblers or Disruptors. During the mission, you can prioritize defeating enemies with anti-warp abilities to keep your retreat option valid. Other than survivability modules, we also recommend anti-scanning modules to make it harder for scanners to detect you, and receive more information in the alert. If possible, you can team up with ships that have a smaller Source Radius, and check whether these ships are receiving warnings to determine if you are safe.</span></p>
