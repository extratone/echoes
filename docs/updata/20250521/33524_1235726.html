                  <p>To New Eden Capsuleers,<br />
EVE Echoes will undergo maintenance on<span style="color:#f39c12;"> 5/21/2025 at 08:00</span> (UTC+0) and will take approximately 120 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to the game. We kindly ask for your understanding and patience during the maintenance.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Content</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#f39c12;">Capital Ship Rig II</span><br />
With the advancement of Capital Ship rigging technology, the Capital Ship Rig II is now available for manufacture and use.<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Use Type I Blueprints, Datacores, and Rigging Experiment Data to perform reverse engineering and obtain Type II blueprints, then manufacture with them.<br />
Tip: Capital Ship Rigging Experiment Data can be obtained from loot crates from Capital Ship Nihilus Space and Capital Ship Proving Grounds.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Integrated Rig</span><br />
4P Combat Integrated Module + and 4P Engineering Integrated Module + are now available for manufacture and use.<br />
Attribute Efficiency: 80%<br />
Multiplier of Rigs Need: 12<br />
How to obtain (Regular): Obtain blueprints (rare drops) by scanning the highest-level Relics, then manufacture with them.<br />
How to obtain (Limited Time): Purchase from the Store's Hot Selection, which is available for a limited time.<br />
Suggestion: Due to the high number of rigs required for integration and the fact that insurance only covers the integrated rig itself, it is not recommended to use it in large-scale battles where destruction is likely.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;">Integrated Rig Precise Dismantling Service</span><br />
You can now use the Precise Dismantling Service to revert integrated rigs back to their unintegrated state. All integrated rigs will be fully returned to the station hangar.<br />
Due to the complexity of the process, using the Precise Dismantling Service requires a service fee (ISK).<br />
This service is suitable for dismantling Advanced Rigs. For basic rigs, it is recommended to use the existing standard dismantling and packing service.<br />
Tip: Integrated rigs can only be dismantled individually. When selecting multiple items for dismantling and packing, integrated rigs will be automatically ignored.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;">New Advanced Implant Unit</span><br />
Five new Advanced Implant Units have been introduced, as follows:<br />
Pulse Crystal Capacitor Reinforcement<br />
An advanced unit for Pulse Crystal that reinforces the ship capacitors. Reduces weapon power consumption during skill activation. Increases the ship's maximum capacitor capacity. Reduces the shield percentage consumed by Reverse Power.<br />
Barrage Repression Firing Reinforcement<br />
An advanced unit that reinforces Barrage Repression firing capabilities. Increase cannon tracking speed. Reduce Barrage Repression restart time. Increase Suppressive Fire duration and enhance the velocity decrease effect.<br />
Thermal Circulation Power Control Reinforcement<br />
An advanced unit for Thermal Circulation that strengthens power control systems. Increase power gain from Salvo. Increase the power cap, but power now decreases faster after overheating. Reduce restrictions on Overdrive skill activation.<br />
Warhead Charge Warhead Reinforcement<br />
An advanced unit for Warhead Charge that enhances warhead-specific effects. Reduce Precision Warhead damage and further decrease its explosion radius. Reduce Range-extending Warhead damage penalties. Increase damage bonuses for the four single-attribute warheads.<br />
Aerospace Tactics Precision Reinforcement<br />
An advanced unit that enhances the precision of aerospace tactic system. Improve drone tracking speed and range. Reduce the explosion radius of fighters.<br />
Due to the variety of implant types, advanced units for other implant types will be introduced later.<br />
How to Obtain:<br />
Purchase from the Store, which is available for a limited time.<br />
It is expected to be added as drops in Malpais in two weeks.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;">Brand-new Returnee Mission System</span><br />
The Returnee System has been revamped and upgraded. Returning Capsuleers can obtain generous rewards through modules such as basic tutorial reviews, 7-day missions, returnee sign-ins, and update guide, helping them reacquaint themselves with New Eden.<br />
Added a basic review mission module to help returning Capsuleers quickly revisit basic content in New Eden. Capsuleers familiar with New Eden can skip some of the missions and claim rewards right away.<br />
Added three types of returnee buffs to assist Capsuleers in improving their capabilities.<br />
1. Repair costs for returnee Capsuleers are reduced by 100%.<br />
2. Rewards for completing Encounters missions as a returnee Capsuleer are increased by 20%.<br />
3. Manufacturing time for items is reduced by 10%.<br />
Added the update guide, allowing returning Capsuleers to quickly learn about the primary gameplay and event content currently available in New Eden.<br />
Consolidated and optimized the 7-day returnee missions.<br />
1. Optimized some of the missions. When the 7-day missions are first generated, they will recommend gameplay missions based on the Capsuleer's returnee questionnaire choices. Capsuleers can also change to other types of mission through refresh.<br />
2. Reduced the number of 7-day missions that can be completed daily, from 5 to 4.<br />
3. Optimized the rewards for 7-day missions. The Aeon Shards reward for each mission is standardized to 400, and the daily max limit of Aeon Shards obtainable has been increased from 1500 to 1600.<br />
Optimized and increased the overall rewards of the returnee system.</p>

<p><span style="color:#f39c12;"><strong>Strengthened Anti-Cheat Penalty Announcement</strong></span><br />
To create a fairer gaming environment and protect Capsuleer interests, the customer service has strengthened the anti-cheat penalties. Capsuleers who identify suspicious individuals can report them to the customer service.<br />
Overview of Four Common Penalty Cases:<br />
Individuals found using cheats to earn bounties or mine will face an initial penalty of 20-40 billion ISK, depending on the impact and duration of use. Continued violations after the first penalty will result in significantly increased penalties, with severe cases leading to permanent bans.<br />
If more than 10 members of the same Corporation are found using cheats, the Corporation will be temporarily restricted from trading, and a portion of its ISK will be deducted.<br />
If more than 20 members of the same Corporation are found using cheats, and the total number of active members is relatively low, the Corporation will be permanently shut down.<br />
Using automated surveillance cheats to monitor local channels will result in a permanent ban.</p>
